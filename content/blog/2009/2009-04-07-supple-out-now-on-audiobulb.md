Presenting: an electro-acoustic album of experimental sound sources and improvisations punctuated by iterative percussion, i.e. glitchy ambient slightly funky dance music. üòâ

_Supple_ is the way I&#8217;ve seen things come together over several years after moving to California, and owes some to dance forms that made this area of the country so important to electronic music development and culture. They are presented in a sort of story-form (I&#8217;ll blame my operatic tendencies for that), where endings and beginnings aren&#8217;t so easily discerned, and overall structure blends them in a sort of high-contrast, watercolor way&#8230; which I think is matched in visual form by <a href="http://gl0tch.com" target="_blank">gl0tch</a> (check out the <a href="http://www.audiobulb.com/albums/AB019/AB019.htm" target="_blank">release page</a> to see different versions of the cover art morphing), giving it all this primordial evolutionary cybernetic aspect that I love, as if everything is a petri dish of mechanically chaotic musical questions.

The tunes span from when I first moved here in 2002 up until 2008; &#8220;Navfrakure&#8221; was laid down as a¬† one-night brush stroke back on a chilly October night, and grew into something quite deeper. Although &#8220;Lusid Crystalin&#8221; is the oldest, written within a month of my relocation from Chicago, &#8220;Topless&#8221; contains samples culled from a recording session with the trio <a href="http://www.discogs.com/artist/Comma+(5)" target="_blank">Comma</a> &#8211; recorded in Brooklyn way back in I think 1999.

Many of these tracks contain and/or are built with free improvisations I do on my homemade instruments and improvisation rig (read my blog further for some descriptions and pics). It&#8217;s an on-going process, building a morphing performance engine, a lot of which was originally from and inspired by my work with Comma, Gray Code, and the free improv scene in general.

Objects and constructions are sampled, voices rendered, and recently my simple DIY analog synths have given an entirely new dimension, all combined together with an array of acoustic instruments (mostly guitar, cello, prepared piano and african hand percussion), and processed with hardware looping and delay devices. In some cases the improv remains relatively intact, in others it is pieced out and chopped as if&#8230; Burroughsian perversions, perhaps? Joycean slips of the tongue, a composting of ideas and pursuasions that melt together as if merging stained&#8230;

&#8220;Sextant&#8221; is a poem I wrote around 2004:

> Blue chrome carriage  
> Mouse brown hair  
> Dark shadowed eyes  
> Cold mean stare
> 
> White-armed glove driver  
> Sunshine in your car  
> If the signal never signaled  
> Would you have gone that far?

The <a href="http://www.audiobulb.com/albums/AB019/AB019.htm" target="_blank">Audiobulb release page</a> contains links to eMusic, iTunes, Thrill Jockey and boomkat sites for purchasing the album. There&#8217;s also an interview with me including other details about the album and music making and creativity and things like that, with clips from some of the tracks I&#8217;ve mentioned here.

<a href="http://earslend.blogspot.com/2009/04/crunchy-seam.html" target="_blank">Lend Me Your Ears has a feature on Supple</a>, as well as an interview that has different questions from the Audiobulb one, very little repeat info! super bonus! There&#8217;s also a free download of track 2, &#8220;Navfrakure.&#8221; Double Super Bonus!

<a href="http://music.ucsd.edu/~tre/" target="_blank">Tom Erbe</a> is one of the members of the electronic music community whose work I highly respect. Not only is most of his software free, not only are they usable by any skill level, not only are they the most educational electronic music tools i&#8217;ve ever used&#8230; I could go on. But the end result is that they sound simple and great.

At long last Tom has released the <a href="http://www.soundhack.com/" target="_blank">SoundHack Delay Trio</a>, the description of the algorithms is fantastic, from the announcement:

> &#8220;All of these are derived from the same basic delay algorithm: a hermite interpolated delay line with variable modulation, and a feedback loop with dc blocking and saturation. Pitch shifting is achieved with a dual head crossfading delay (ala Eltro Tempophon/Dennis Gabor/Pierre Schaeffer phonogene) and is decidedly low-Ô¨Å. The saturating feedback also allows them to be great drone and noise generators.&#8221;

Awesome work! Can&#8217;t wait to get this one in action, I have something going now that begs for some new delay. üòâ

Two of my other favorites of Tom&#8217;s are **decimate+** and of course the ubiquitous **SoundHack**, both available (along with a TON of others) on the <a href="http://www.soundhack.com/freeware.php" target="_blank">SoundHack Freeware page</a>.

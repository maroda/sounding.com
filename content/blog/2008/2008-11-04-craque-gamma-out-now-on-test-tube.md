October brought many exciting things for me, including not only a <a href="http://rackable.com" target="_blank">new job</a>, but also a new album that I&#8217;m very excited about. The <a href="http://monocromatica.com/netlabel/" target="_blank">Test Tube</a> netlabel is featuring this new release, called **Gamma**.

Six tracks, mostly beat-driven, of downtempo styled expressionism ripe with electro-acoustic improvisation; acousmatica for the brainwaves.

I was also honored to have Matt Mercer (of Microfilm) write up the release on Under the Lens, here&#8217;s an excerpt from the <a href="http://underthelens.livejournal.com/196576.html" target="_blank">full article</a>:

> Craque [is] a project of highly abstract instrumental electronic music that often defies easy categorization. He&#8217;s not afraid of melody or traditional rhythm, even at times can lay down a healthy groove, but most of his music is characterized by heavily processed and manipulated sounds derived from everyday objects. Typically, though, these sounds are far removed from the source and take on a weird, synthetic life of their own.

Also from the <a href="http://monocromatica.com/netlabel/releases/tube143.htm" target="_blank">release page</a>:

> &#8230;Craque assaults our senses with an eclectic amalgam of rich rhythmic patterns that derivate from dub, hip hop, techno and other urban languages, but instead of driving us straight to the physical emotion center, they drive us to the &#8216;braindance&#8217; center&#8230; Excellent and extremely elegant electronic music.

If you&#8217;re in San Fran, do not miss the North American premiere of Brian Eno&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.77millionpaintings.com/">77 Million Paintings</a> exhibit at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ybca.org/">Yerba Buena Center for the Arts</a> the weekend of June 29th. </p> 

This looks like a fantastic thing, what&#8217;s even cooler is that it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/06/an_army_of_macs.html">all done with Macs!</a> </p> 

You can also buy the work on DVD, but obviously it was meant for a grand space. Details of the event are on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.longnow.org/77m/">Long Now Foundation website.</a></p>

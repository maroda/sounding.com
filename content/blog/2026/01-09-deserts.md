I was thinking today about the way<br>
that deserts are averages.<br>
The South Pacific as much as<br>
the middle of the Sahara,<br>
the ridge of Everest<br>
or surface of the Moon;<br>
all feel like manifestations,<br>
things being pulled to a center.<br>
They find an advantage there,<br>
the sustaining average.<br>

<br>

Far reaches of the Ocean <br>
seem all but devoid of life,<br>
a standing-wave of non-happening.<br>
No wave in the water,<br>
no cloud in the sky,<br>
molecules standing no-wind,<br>
no-moving thing.<br>
If I were there, in a boat or a raft,<br>
I might only hear my breathing<br>
and wonder if the tinnitus<br>
was the horizon.<br>

<br>

Deserts are fascinating<br>
maybe because they're big.<br>
Adventurers have crossed them<br>
in major feats of strength!<br>
But some that didn't make it<br>
give deserts a threatening aspect;<br>
they crave a cycle of sameness.<br>
To a desert's ears<br>
a change is violent,<br>
a voice is death.<br>

<br>

These mathematically unforgiving places<br>
bring friction and force<br>
to whip wide unsurvivable spaces;<br>
averaged to zero, a desolate course at last.<br>

<br>

Left to themselves,<br>
deserts level what is put there:<br>
buildings in the Mojave<br>
are returned to the Mojave<br>
unless life-reinforced,<br>
inhabited by voices.<br>

<br>

A greedy desert's pristine average<br>
changes with diversity.<br>
Where it appears their perfectly<br>
bubble-sphere ecosystems become lumpy,<br>
deserts edge into complexity with life.<br>
Where life survives, adaptation follows.<br>

<br>

Natural selection knows<br>
how the averages work<br>
as the complexity grows,<br>
lifting above the desert<br>
like a kite in a hurricane.<br>

<br>

Life outside the desert<br>
flying kites in a storm of abstractions:<br>
Data oceans, idempotent functions,<br>
clouds of computers, trees of networks,<br>
layers of support, hierarchies of management,<br>
cultural scaffolding of beliefs, <br>
shared goals, corporate missions,<br>
mass-produced furniture building instructions.<br>

<br>

All abstracted by averages,<br>
lowly lowest common denominator,<br>
enabling more across more agents,<br>
black boxes for measuring everything,<br>
instructions for understanding nothing.<br>
To understand, or have expertise,<br>
is not a desert thing.<br>

<br>

Like artificial language models,<br>
a fraction is stolen,<br>
the edges of diversity cut away,<br>
negative feedback swells,<br>
forming dunes of bulleted lists<br>
with instructions on sameness.<br>
The desert a precipice of sanity,<br>
full of hallucinations,<br>
chemical and biting,<br>
cares not.<br>

<br>

For averages are controllable,<br>
they are printable in headlines.<br>
A cancer of averages gives<br>
growth for sameness-sake <br>
to better control us my dear,<br>
snuffing the very diversity<br>
nourishing the advantage<br>
of our average.<br>

<br>

As Power wants control,<br>
competing levels emerge,<br>
survivability pulled too far,<br>
it dashes and flattens,<br>
competition rattled,<br>
reaching closer to the desert-like<br>
numbness of power,<br>
a Kudzu Republic reigns<br>
and chokes itself to grow.<br>

<br>

A desert does not live.<br>
It averages, empty<br>
to everything but itself.<br>
Respecting the desert<br>
as a lonely place,<br>
average-engulfed,<br>
we breathe it.<br>

<br>

Because with a reversal becoming<br>
the empty block of wood,<br>
a silent piano piece<br>
with every sound,<br>
we give it a voice<br>
to suffocate the sameness,<br>
flourishing into life<br>
no perfect moiré<br>
but an emerald-dithered garden.<br>

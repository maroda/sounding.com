    "body": "You have probably heard the phrase ‚Äúpractice makes perfect‚Äù, but let‚Äôs take that thought up and out. It is really the experience of practice that is more interesting!\nConsider a jazz band you‚Äôve heard or seen live, or really any type of music where improvisation plays an important role. Great bands work together effortlessly, and when things go sideways or ‚Äúwrong notes‚Äù are played, they quickly adapt to the changing conditions in order to keep the music going. This emergent complex system manifests itself in the awesome jams you hear.\nTo approach the problem of how to better understand increasingly complex software systems, we can learn a great deal from improvising musicians. We can build our group intuition like they do with ongoing practice and turn the next incident into just another time we‚Äôre getting together to practice. We may find that incidents become non-events, like those ‚Äúwrong notes‚Äù in jazz, after all the complex system is doing the same things when it is successful as it does when it fails: regular work.\nAnd we humans are right there in the middle, with our unshareable mental models and assumptions about what others know. We are susceptible to losing Common Ground all the time, but especially in a high-pressure Joint Activity like musical performances‚Ä¶ or, you know, incidents in software.\nConsider the technology teams you are in and adjacent to, or even the ones you don‚Äôt know about. Think about the complex system that is your software platform, that relates all these teams. When that incident happens, how much of a surprise is it? How quickly does the team adapt to the ‚Äúwrong notes‚Äù and keep the music going?\nDerek Bailey, a well-known English guitarist and improviser, put it succinctly: ‚ÄúImprovisation has no existence outside of its practice‚Äù. In fact, he embodies Improvisational Music as ‚Äúthe practice of practice‚Äù. When that band gets together to play a show, it is just another time they‚Äôre getting together to play, and it won‚Äôt be like any other practice because they will keep learning new things.\nWhen a technology team employs Continuous Verification techniques, they are leaning into this Practice of Practice. It helps bring stubborn mental models together so the team can better navigate the complex system at hand, guiding it through turbulent conditions and learning in the process.\nResilience and Diversity in complex systems is the foundation for my talk: Music in Resilience: The Practice of Practice. The talk juxtaposes Improvisational Music and Software Engineering, most notably how the Joint Activities of musical performance transfer to the way we think about the Joint Activities of software operations.\nDownload the slides from Sparklecon VII 2020 or see the full video from RE:Deploy 2019.\n",

    "title": "Anti-Bias of Listening Deeply",

    "description": "",
    "body": "Getting around cognitive biases (like ‚Äúhindsight is 20/20‚Äù or a confirmation you expect) is akin to Listening Deeply. I don‚Äôt mean paying more attention gives better insight. I mean what matters is the entirety of your sonic awareness.\n  There is a composer / meditative approach to sound pioneered by Pauline Oliveros called Deep Listening. I have practiced it, all too briefly with her, but mostly with others taught by her. It is actually a discipline you can be certified to teach, which I am not, so here I refer to it as Listening Deeply.\nIt is something that has become an integral part of my life not only as a composer and improviser, but also in how I deal with my ‚Äúmonkey mind‚Äù working in technology: constantly replaying scenes from recent memory, kicking the big red ‚Äúwhatever you do don‚Äôt analyze this‚Äù button, attempting to deterministically predict the future based on my own excruciatingly limited knowledge of a continuously adaptive world, getting in my head while washing dishes, etc. Listening calms and centers, it leaves me more open to inspiration.\nMy psychological states notwithstanding, when in this mode of Listening Deeply I have noticed the ease at which I ‚Äúhear sounds coming‚Äù and am not so surprised by them. I attribute it to how this kind of specialized listening can enhance the physical act of hearing complex sounds, which you may be surprised to learn is a serial activity.\nrecord scrrrrratch‚Ä¶! amirite?!\nYes, difficult to fathom, but it‚Äôs (mostly) true. Of all our senses, only the sense of hearing is fundamentally serial because the anatomic structures we (and other non-human animals) evolved to survive are thanks to the nature of complex sound waves.\n  We may not realize that our consciousness is not called upon to immediately ascertain the streaming series of discrete pitches heard ‚Äúone at a time‚Äù that lets us know it is a certain type of birdsong, breakfast frying in the skillet, or a bamboo glade. Those are all immediately recognizable mental models that we‚Äôve learned to intuit through the experience of hearing them over and over.\nSo, I want to pull your focus away from the things we hear, the interpretation our brain implants about the world around us, what the confounding mystery of Cognition formulates as a ‚Äòsound object‚Äô. Instead, consider the nature of sound as the vibration of a thing interacting with a surrounding medium through the promulgation of waves, ultimately picked up by tiny bones in our bodies.\nOur ear canal is tuned finely to capture the most complete spectrum of sound allowed by the evolutionary phenotype of the human need to process sound waves. That is to say, nature selected the profile of our (quite good, but not best in the animal kingdom) hearing that pulled us along our evolutionary path to be the listeners we are today, one waveform cycle at a time.\nThis matches our instinct about Music. Our intuition is linked to our instincts, so even though we don‚Äôt know how to improvise jazz, we know it has a cool rhythm. Some folks nod to a hypnotic house beat, others to a hiphop groove, and the percentage of those who create all this music are as minuscule as the stapes of the middle-ear is to the rest of our skeleton.\nTaking this one step further, any topic regarding sound is inextricably tied to the phenomenon of Time, and if there‚Äôs one thing Surprises in Complex Systems depend on (including jazz and networked software systems alike), it is that the Arrow of Time does not stop.\nNow, back to the action of what it means to Listen Deeply. Without going into Fast Fourier Transforms and logarithmic graphs of resonance and frequency response, I ask that you trust a trained musician to tell you that our brains are REALLY GOOD at piecing together these ‚Äòsound objects‚Äô from the serial intake of frequencies by our (hopefully two good stereophonic) ears. For now, we‚Äôll also ignore the fact that you hear yourself primarily through the bones in your head, and some modern amplification and hearing-aid technology exploits this in wonderful ways. Not the point.\nThe point is also not that I am somehow moving us abstractly ‚Äúbeyond‚Äù the objects our brains know about. No, the point is listening so that we preempt these thoughts. We are, in fact, expanding our mental model by experiencing the context of the complex (sonic) system in action. Sound familiar, Chaos Engineers? üòâ\nTry it.\nGive yourself a time limit (it can be super-short, seconds or minutes), and only listen. If you are ‚Äúthinking‚Äù that you‚Äôre listening, you are not listening. If you find yourself anticipating what will be heard next, you are not listening. Naming objects or recognizing things? Try not to (see ‚Äúno thinking‚Äù). On the other hand, if you find yourself surprised that you could hear the fly coming long before it zips by your head, you‚Äôre on the right track.\n  Once I am in the zone with this (inspiration is another topic I will revisit soon), it feels like I am constantly inhaling, like I have to stop doing it because I need to exhale. It becomes so obviously visceral that it helps to link it to breathing so I don‚Äôt forget to actually inhale. You‚Äôll hear often that a good way to calm yourself and get into a meditative attitude is to focus on your breathing, it‚Äôs a great way to ease into Listening Deeply as well.\nIn this fugue-like state, sounds simply‚Ä¶ become. They are not anticipated, but emerge out of an indeterminate landscape. All sounds begin to be equalized; not in volume or strength, but with importance. They build their own relevance to each other, resonant or not, and soon an entire aural ecosystem emerges in your ears. It is an action that slows the world down and brings your brain into wonderfully abstract, unfamiliar territory where discoveries are there to accident, to where resilience be.\nMaking discoveries leads to building new mental models and more dimensional understanding. Having an intuition about the sequence of sounds that make up the courting pendulum of a hummingbird means it doesn‚Äôt seem as harsh than if you were surprised by its sound when not listening to all of the sounds.\nThe bias of what may have happened and what could occur is not as beneficial as deeper learning from all of the complex system, not just trying to interpret the loud bangs when its disturbances surprise us.\nFeels a bit like an ode to carpe diem, but in perspective also shouting for discovery in experiment!\nFor more on Pauline Oliveros and Deep Listening, visit https://www.deeplistening.org.\n",

    "body": "Fanny\u0026#8217;s Music, East Nashville\n  Cicada, cricket, grasshopper, frog. However that particular indeterminate carpet of sound occurs, it is a permanent feature of the American South. I grew up in this soup, so hearing this familiar symphony again after nearly two decades of being away felt surreal and magical.\nIt is the sound that framed my stay in Nashville, Music City, for three mini-conferences all held at once at the Nossi College of Art: Music City Agile, Music City Code, and Music City Data. Although tickets were sold separately, it was all mixed together, so all attendees had access to everything. I recall being initially impressed by their high-quality social media campaign, and getting to the venue the conference Crew did not disappoint.\nart on the walls at Nossi  Music City Tech was well organized, well-staffed, expertly choreographed (at least from my vantage point, whatever demons they found were hidden well), and thoughtfully planned. The personal attention given to speakers made it special. The organizers were friendly, helpful, thoughtful, and courteous. Southern Hospitality was at its pinnacle here.\nI would say that this all made it feel like a well-oiled, small event‚Ä¶ except that 900 attendees and nearly 200 talks and workshops over three days isn‚Äôt exactly small. Not only that, it was the most diverse group I‚Äôve seen yet at a tech conference, which really made me smile, as did the attention to including Music-themed talks!\nI have written a few things related to my talk, The Music in Resilience (aka The Practice of Practice), so I won‚Äôt really go into it here (blog version, soon enough). Instead, what I want to embolden is this thread of confluence between musical and sociotechnical systems that I see showing up in other peoples‚Äô thinking.\ninstruments on the show floor!  Before jumping into the other talks, it helps to underscore a central theme from mine that was strongly emphasized in all: being on a technology team is like being in a band. An important tool for a collaborative team to maneuver the challenges of complex systems, software or musical, is to build group intuition.\nThe Sounds of Software Brett Berliner (@brettberliner)\nPrincipal Software Engineer, Insight Right away Brett made the connection that many people make and that I‚Äôve heard all my life: musicians make excellent computer people and computer people love music (he has personally attended 500+ live shows). He started off by drawing a clear parallel between great team communication and people getting together as a band and practicing.\ngeeks geek out to the afterparty band\n  I felt a bit like I was lounging in a levitating gondolier, floating low above the surface, with our guide pointing out topography below of how music and coding intersected. Using himself as Exhibit A, we were shown early listening devices (boom box, portable CDs, mp3 player pioneers), logos of usual suspects in online music services (props for Bandcamp mentioned), and even headphone recommendations. He explained the methodology for choosing songs for his shared playlists, crafted for various moods and temperament while working.\nLastly was an introduction to live music coding, including something I‚Äôve used before called ChucK, but mostly featuring a (successful!) live demo of Sonic Pi. This came before my talk on Friday, and although I normally never go to talks before I give one, I wanted to make sure I saw this because I had a feeling I could relate.\nDoes Your Team Groove? What You Can Learn from a Bass Player!\nDavid Gentry\nScrum Master, Agile Coach A good deal of the sponsorship appeared to revolve around Agile practices and general team organization and efficiency. Part of the Agile conference track, this talk was my favorite. He even brought a copy of The Music Lesson by Victor Wooten ‚Äì source material and inspiration for his subject ‚Äì to give away. You know I grabbed it.\n Good Groove is everything but the notes, Good Agile is everything but the process.  Right away the familiar motif returned, and ‚Äúplaying with other people‚Äù underlined everything, again making the astute observation that collaboration in teams is the real action of playing with people. I think he and I share the same view that this is not strictly allegorical. As such, David more strongly resonated with the subject matter of my talk, really digging into specifics, not being satisfied merely by comparison and simile.\nLike I do with idiomatic improvisation and complex systems, so does David link bass playing and the Scrum Master, believing in that deep connection, feeling it himself. These relationships aren‚Äôt only useful because of being relatable to the prevalence of Music in the lives of humans, they also tickle the same cognitive space as collaboration in software engineering.\nDavid and his bass came to play!  He covers six territories of overlap: 1) Servant Leadership as a Scrum Master is akin to the place of the bass in a band, a foundational but often not obvious carrier of the ground; 2) Congruence as the rhythm and harmony holding things together, not noticed until incorrect or missing; 3) Cadence as tempo, synchronization, pulse, and timeboxed structures; 4) Conflict as dissonance that eventually balances to illuminate resolution and discovery; 5) Space as one of the greatest things to give or receive, with characteristics of trust, self-organization, psychological safety, and freedom to innovate; 6) Groove as everything about music but the notes, or in Agile as anything except the process.\nHis electric bass was at the ready, playing along with simple accompaniment through a single amplifier, giving examples of each of these six in its musical context, while also showing common language used in the sociotechnical one. Triplets against dotted rhythms for Congruence and walking jazz bass for Conflict were especially good, and hey we were even ‚ÄòJourney-rolled‚Äô once he made it all the way to Groove. Don‚Äôt stop believin‚Äô in Agile, I guess? üòâ\nWhat is Kafka? TicketMaster‚Äôs Data Streaming Journey\nPooja Rallabhandi (@pzralla)\nSoftware Engineer III, TicketMaster defunct PC store, East Nashville  What I liked about this was its connection to Music through a mature, massive, and borderless sociotechnical system that has grown in complexity over nearly half a century. After steering any hecklers away from TicketMaster‚Äôs pricing model, Pooja flew at a high level about Kafka‚Äòs pillars, giving a brief overview of the value in persistent Commit Logs and the relationship of producers and consumers with brokers.\nThe T.M. Core database surely isn‚Äôt the same technology in use 43 years ago, right? Although ‚Ä¶ [queue time travel sequence soundtrack] ‚Ä¶ I fondly remember operating the TicketMaster VAX terminal at Tower Records 15 years ago, itself reminding me of the VAX at Virginia Tech we used for email 10 years before that ‚Ä¶ ok, so maybe it‚Äôs not that unbelievable. She explained that attempting to solve their problems with normal queue products like ActiveMQ simply didn‚Äôt work, ultimately choosing Kafka to front the read layer of their access model for ticketing.\nTicket order transactions go directly to T.M. Core, maybe through some other logistics prior, but nothing touches Kafka yet. That happens when the data gets aggregated and prepared for display ‚Äì for example on your phone for scanning right after you bought it or for resellers, where immediate updates would be needed ‚Äì and a near-real-time stream of data is required. That‚Äôs where Kafka‚Äôs speed and durability comes to the rescue, which they bolster even further with their own strong consistency guarantees by performing snapshot comparisons. It is an elegant example of the tried-and-true separation of reads and writes so familiar to efficient database usage._afterparty jugglers and geeks converge_\n DevOps Philosophy vs Practice\nPJ Hagerty (@aspleenic)\nFounder, DevRelate.io This one had nothing overtly to do with Music but neatly supports our central theme. The reason I wanted to check this out was not only that PJ was basically the one other speaker there I even remotely knew, not because he recommends the CI/CD tool I have most recently experienced (GoCD), not due to his self-proclaimed musicianship (I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a fine singing saw player), not even because he called out Chaos Engineering with a Netflix tale, but because the general topic touches an exposed nerve of mine.\n The key is that teams work together, the most important part of DevOps is communication.  Nevertheless, his presentation attempted to move us away from the catchphrases so often associated with DevOps, instead dialing-in on how modern tooling supports a cross-disciplined cooperative environment. I am particularly interested in this perspective because Chaos Engineering plugs directly into concepts of group learning in a sociotechnical complex system, especially Game Days (outlined in my talk as ‚ÄòThe Practice of Practice‚Äô).\nHe also gave a shout-out to another sociotechnical subject near and dear to my heart: SRE. Only he called it Site Reliability Expert. I think my tweet on this sums it up nicely:Sweet talk on DevOps philosophy at @MusicCityTech from @aspleenic. Favorite part was calling SRE ‚ÄúSite Reliability Expert‚Äù, which I love. Because, folks, we‚Äôre all site reliability engineers. What we need are experts. Freudian slip? Maybe. The acronym gauntlet has been thrown. \u0026mdash; Matt Davis (@dtauvdiodr) \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/dtauvdiodr/status/1170409058542792704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\u0026quot;\u0026gt;September 7, 2019\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;    This ‚Äòmistake‚Äô actually fit into the talk perfectly, because eschewing the buzzwords really helped make it all about practical combinations of tool and theory, and PJ readily handed out toolset recommendations by continuously relating their practicality to the overreaching philosophy of DevOps.\nWhat is that philosophy, you ask? It‚Äôs pretty simple, and it was refreshing to hear someone else say so. Above all, the key is that teams work together. The most important part of DevOps is communication. In fact, it makes sense to think about DevOps as something that needs multiple perspectives to exist at all. Maybe DevOps is everything about software engineering except the code.\nMusic City  The Gambling Stick BBQ  It felt good spreading the word of Chaos Engineering and Resilience to more ears, and it was spectacular to be a part of the conference. Having been at a few conferences lately that happen on the (US) coasts, it is striking that trends and conversations around the resilience of complex systems and new ways of thinking about safety aren‚Äôt being as heavily preached in more landlocked locales. At both here and Texas Linux Fest earlier this year, the number of hands going up for the question ‚Äúwho has heard of Chaos Engineering‚Äù was one or less, even in casual conversations. I am finding that this subject seems to get a lot less attention in so-called ‚Äòflyover‚Äô areas than it would at a coastal conference. This needs to change, and my team at Verica is in the game to help make that happen.\nI decided to stay over in Nashville a bit afterward to experience some of the city (and sorely missed southern BBQ), fortunate to have a friend and coworker there with whom I also wanted to spend time. So imagine my joy when she surprised me on Saturday with a message that ‚ÄúDuet for Theremin and Lap Steel‚Äù from Atlanta (@duetonline) would be performing that night at a sake distillery downtown.\nOf course, without a moment‚Äôs hesitation, I said yes._DFTALS at Proper Sake, Nashville_\n",

It‚Äôs why I got involved and loved my years on WUVT and WMUC DJ‚Äôing, why I have always had a side-‚Äòjob‚Äô as a DJ, why I made mixtapes in high school and recordings of my sets to share.\nThis was going to be a tweet thread but turned into something longer. So as a peek behind the scenes, here‚Äôs how‚Äôs my workday sonic rotation works!\nThe Sonic Atmosphere There are a lot of times I have nothing playing, but I am listening to what‚Äôs around me, inside and out. Often I go on listening walks for both meditation and exercise. I might even pick up an instrument in my studio and play a bit.\nDo I have it on vinyl? If I think of something, like a style or a specific artist, I will first check the stax of wax. It could be anything from Zappa to John Cage or Autechre to Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.\nIs it easily accessible vinyl? This is actually a requirement of the previous item, except that it will depend entirely on the artist or piece in question. If I have a hankering for an original UK release of an early ‚Äô70s Jethro Tull album, I‚Äôm gonna have to hit the big shelves.\nDo I want random play? Then it‚Äôs to iTunes, hit random, ~2600 albums worth of tracks can show up in any order the pseudo-random (it plays repeats a LOT) algorithm chooses. The fun part here, of course, is family members experiencing the avant-garde nature of a huge swath of my collection (e.g. Merzbow‚Äôs 13 Japanese Birds: Karasu just came on random followed by a track from Funky Desert Breaks).\nDo I want a specific artist or style not on vinyl? Self-explanatory I think. If I have the artist on vinyl, that wins. If I don‚Äôt have it, I check my digital collection. Very rarely I will come across something I know I have somewhere in 500+ CDs but not on-disk and I‚Äôll take that chance to rip it.\nDo I want a specific artist I don‚Äôt have or want more of? The first place I check is .bandcamp.com, then a Discogs search. YouTube helps with more obscure stuff, too. Pro tip: if you‚Äôre sharing music, check if it‚Äôs on Bandcamp first! Tracks are all embeddable.\nOn the BBQ porch with only an internet-connected streaming device? That‚Äôs easy: Somafm. My go-to is Cliqhop or Groove Salad(s). Drone Zone is always great too, and some of the loungey stuff is great dinner music. I also never miss Wait Wait Don‚Äôt Tell Me.\nWhat I don‚Äôt do? I don‚Äôt buy streaming services. I donate to Somafm, I use my own collection. I won‚Äôt bother listing them, but there are some I won‚Äôt even use embedded. I‚Äôm pretty firmly on the David Crosby and Marc Ribot side of this argument.\nThat‚Äôs it! Easy enough, but I do have a huge collection to my advantage. I understand that streaming services are very easy for a large majority of people to be exposed to new music, but this is why I share.

    "description": "",
    "body": "Me at the Palace of Fine Arts, workshop eve  Walking late one afternoon after a day deep in Cognitive Systems and Resilience Engineering workshops, chatting with one of the eminent researchers in the field, the conversation circled around common ground in joint activity and sociotechnical systems sharing qualities with music ensembles. I remember agreeing how some uncategorizable thing exists on both sides as an outcome, where a result far greater than merely the sum of its parts occurs.\nMusic isn‚Äôt just the combination of the instruments, it‚Äôs the way in which humans push their operation forward through time both creating and adapting to the music and each other simultaneously. I feel like adaptive capacity in a resilient system works much the same way, and this workshop helped confirm my thinking. Here are some reflections about how it forged new connections between my Ops mind and my Musical one (which are not that far apart already).\nWhat is this thing? I‚Äôve learned that I have latched onto bits of information when discovering. Something will catch my eye or ear and make a little meerkat synapse in my brain stand up and look around and go, ‚Äúhold up, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù It‚Äôs probably the element of my psyche that drives my vinyl record store diving. I am not sure I would have never become the Paul Bowles fanatic I am without first hearing ‚ÄúTea in the Sahara‚Äù by The Police in the ‚Äô80s. Never would have come across the thinking of Gilles Deleuze while studying music if I didn‚Äôt ask myself ‚Äúwhy is this record label called Mille Plateaux?‚Äù\nA Thousand Plateaus (1980) is a tome Deleuze penned with F√©lix Guattari that discusses artists, musicians, psychoanalysts, historians and all sorts of other things having to do with asking questions about reality. It‚Äôs heady, as metaphysics and social philosophy tend to be, but one takeaway I like is that ‚Äòexperience‚Äô necessarily includes the novelty of ideas and actions. That means newness. Discovery! An expansion of knowledge, an unbounded dimension of insight, an openness to adapt, embracing the unknown and the unexpected.\nIn fact, later that workshop evening, as a bunch of Human Factors geeks had drinks in a hipster place with fake wood stoves, I learned of someone who has done recent research on cognition in jazz improvisation. Wonderfully adjacent to my own interests, and I may have never heard about it under other circumstances. I love these tendrils of discovery, and it‚Äôs those veins of potentials that Deleuze is suggesting belong to a Body without Organs.\nReal Work Regardless of whether Deleuze speaks of art, philosophy, or science, his view emphasizes that we are the most interested in how something works. In fact real work ‚Äì the things you and I do every day to complete our job titles ‚Äì cannot be separated from the surprises and adjustments that lie therein. Any number of virtual possibilities potentially describe our engagement with a complex system beyond its components, beyond its recognizable organs and their describable arrangement.\nI‚Äôm no philosophy student, so an evaluation of metaphysics isn‚Äôt my goal here. Nevertheless, when I perceive new angles of thinking about things in different ways, I jump on them as opportunities to discover something about a topic through following a different, sometimes oddball, perspective of that topic. Again, the latch-and-tendril effect. In the spirit of Mille Plateaux, I will proceed dutifully Postmodern and arbitrarily decontextualize a bit I can latch onto!\nI have already mentioned the Body without Organs (BwO). It is a strange concept, and not one that I immediately grokked (the wikipedia entry may help). However, on that day of Cognitive Systems workshops, I learned that there was actually an entire discipline built around the indeterminacy that I loved to see in nature and society and the things we build and operate. Suddenly, I knew the BwO better. The uncertainty of the world practically describes it, so I began to wonder how it relates and connects things outside of metaphysics. Like musical improvisation and resilience engineering.\nThe Non-Thing? The BwO is one way to think about the thingness of complex systems beyond their components, where effects and outcomes may be more interesting than systemic organ function. That sounds like the opposite of a thing, but that‚Äôs the point; it‚Äôs not the thing, but beyond the thing. The thing has limited, if any, control over what its BwO looks like.\nFor my purposes, it resembles inherent Chaos. For instance, it is not that outside agents cause this of their own unpredictable accord (‚Äúour users/jr.engineers give us this already‚Äù), but that combinations of all factors create unpredictable outputs at the boundaries of competence. There‚Äôs just no way of knowing, but there are potential possibilities.\nWhen the thing is a complex socio-technical system, we already know that diversity and collaboration help understand it well beyond its organs. More expansive than just a ‚Äúwhole that is greater than the sum of its parts‚Äù. The result of the complex system is a condition that only exists in real-time, and is ultimately empirical and practical in application; it simply cannot exist contained within a theory or design.\nThis is ‚Äúthe practice of practice‚Äù that guitarist Derek Bailey ascribes to the music in his book Improvisation. It does not exist outside of its practice, it is beyond just musicians and any score. The music itself is not a combination of elements and not more than the sum of its parts, indeed that implies a linear relationship and a known quantity! Instead, it is expansive along the various potential faultlines of novelty and experience set before it.\n!Theory My mentor and musicology professor in grad school would always pronounce that word like ‚Äúthhheeeaoryy‚Äù and we‚Äôd laugh and go about our day putting screws between piano strings. So keep in mind that these examples are not so much about the metaphysical concept of the Body without Organs, but rather how I‚Äôve recognized its qualities in other disciplines, outside of theory.\n The Cognitive Systems workshop introduced me to a wonderful talk by another researcher in Resilience Engineering, Dr. Richard Cook (Adaptive Capacity Labs), titled Bone is Resilience. He shows how adaptive capacity among interoperable body systems continuously regenerate and strengthen bone as the result of a complex system. It involves everything from diet and vitamin intake to blood circulation and bone marrow operation, not to mention each of those systems, in turn, all cooperate with other systems that would seem to have nothing to do with bone growth. These are all quite literal organs. What‚Äôs not codified as an organ, or otherwise described as one, is the result of what happens when bones build robustness along lines of stress, heal fractures, or even just grow in a world dominated by gravity. Bone system adaptation along the axis of time is descriptive of a Body without Organs. Another example that comes to mind is the notion that work-as-planned is never work-in-practice. Rather than say ‚Äúall models are false‚Äù, maybe it makes more sense that all models aren‚Äôt models unless they contain a BwO, or the real work of the system, its potentials. Which of course requires the existence of a ‚Äònon-static model‚Äô to differentiate it from the system-as-designed (i.e. work-as-planned). If the system-as-designed is the organs, elements of putting these organ-ic systems into practice comprise the non-static model, which includes its Body without Organs. A crucial lesson from the workshop is the idea that what we‚Äôre studying when we analyze why a complex system fails is the same domain as what happens when it succeeds. Bob Edwards (Human \u0026amp; Organizational Performance Coach) taught and talked about this, putting it beautifully: ‚ÄúTo understand failure, study success. The same things that are there when failure happens are the same things that are there when success happens.‚Äù Including all potentials on the same stratum, success or failure, is descriptive of a Body without Organs. Finally, improvisational music is squarely in this realm. The obvious answer is, well of course it is! Mental models and Bailey‚Äôs ‚Äúpractice of practice‚Äù are quintessentially BwO domains. They are defined by the novelty of their creation in each individual, and when combined with other individuals create a much greater understanding of the whole. The ongoing collaborative understanding of a complex system as it changes and adapts is descriptive of a Body without Organs.  Practical Postulating Virtual Potentials What I‚Äôve been describing in these examples that include virtual potentials (i.e. indeterminacy or unknown unknowns) is described by Deleuze as a ‚ÄòHealthy BwO‚Äô. They are non-static planes of existence, fluid and open to reframing and adaptation. Not necessarily bad, not necessarily good. Just all bits of the same virtual potential, creating new knowledge.\nThe goals behind adaptive approaches to managing complexity consider this. A central workshop motif was our everchanging, adaptive world. My interests over the years have resonated with this, I am fascinated with discovery and change, and realize a lot of my art ‚Äì visual and sonic ‚Äì reflects that.\nMy current work interests follow the same themes, most certainly Chaos Engineering. Its goal is not to cause damage or create chaos, but to employ careful experimentation to examine what Dr. David Woods calls the system‚Äôs graceful extensibility, and how it is exposed during the loss of integrity at an operational boundary. These distributed systems we build quickly corporate a Body without Organs almost merely by their variable nature alone, any observation is one in the past, we cannot know the state of the system. As they begin operating at boundaries of competence, they encounter novel modes of potential, whether it be an outage or a surprise efficiency. Chaos Engineering experimentation really becomes a window into the BwO, not an element of it.\nThe Equality of Immanence When you think that this thing has both good and bad stuff in it, and they‚Äôre both as variable as the other, it comes pretty close to another feature of Deleuze called the ‚ÄòPlane of Immanence‚Äô. That sounds lofty, but it‚Äôs the opposite. It simply means one thing: life, death, consciousness, spirituality, all of it is equal in the same metaphysical flux. None of it ‚Äòtranscends‚Äô any other bit of it. This struck me as similar to the ‚Äònew view‚Äô of safety espoused by Sydney Dekker, where there is no such thing as a transcending root cause explanation like human error. The alternative is what Deleuze might call a ‚ÄòCancerous BwO‚Äô: petrified regeneration of static patterns, recursive and stuck in linearity. I would certainly say the ‚Äò5 Whys‚Äô and ‚ÄòRoot Cause Analysis‚Äô are elements of a pathologically cancerous Body without Organs.\nThe Healthy BwO concept, even as an allegory, makes sense in our adaptive world. The way to survive an environment that is constantly changing isn‚Äôt to create barriers and simplifications, but to embrace its Immanence and maneuver complexity with diverse perspectives instead of fighting it, because virtual potentials will happen whether we like them or not.\nThe most memorable lesson I got from the workshop is that there is a simple answer to complexity: Let it happen.\n",

You‚Äôre working on multiple pieces independently, so as you make changes automation pulls it all together in orderly Continuous Integration. At the right moment, your team‚Äôs work is pushed and Continuous Delivery does the job. Five deploys a day? No problem. Y‚Äôall have written, collaborated, tested, and published your glorious stuff. Job well done!!!\nJust kidding, you‚Äôre not done. Does anyone write software that will suddenly just stop? Ok, maybe Y2K mitigation. But most of us in this industry want to see our stuff keep running into the unforeseeable future. That‚Äôs where Continuous Verification enters the picture. In operations, we‚Äôve been given the ball to ensure the reliability of the software you write, but we want to be as invested in running it into the future as you are in writing it.\n  So, long story short (and trust me it‚Äôs long), that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now at a company called Verica. We are a Continuous Verification company. It‚Äôs an area closely aligned with Human Factors Engineering, Resilience Engineering, Safety, and Chaos Engineering. In fact, Chaos Engineering is central to what we do. We are here to help the enterprise get a leg up on Continuous Verification for the complex distributed systems they run. Tested in production, like the glass says.\nAt Verica, I‚Äôm still doing ops. I am SRE, I am Sr. Infrastructure Engineer, I am IT, I am NetEng, I am Purchasing, I am UAT. When we get some, I‚Äôll be DataOps. Nevertheless, I‚Äôm beginning to traverse a lot more of the software stack than I ever have before (Golang and service meshes, reluctantly Python, you can rip my Zsh from my cold dead hands). I am excited to teach and speak and collaborate on all things Chaos Engineering, especially how it intersects with my musical proclivities. I will be speaking at Texas Linux Fest at the end of May about this very topic!\nMost of all I‚Äôm excited to work with a stellar team. These are people I‚Äôve changed up my life and taken great risks to work beside. Five years ago I discovered there was a close similarity between indeterminacy in distributed systems and the things I have studied in music.

    "body": " Plenty of people who work in technology are musicians. Plenty of humans are musicians, and all of us are listening, even those who cannot hear. In my travels through datacenters and software, I have come across musicians like myself who have not only done double-duty with their computer science and creative lives but also relate and interweave them. If they‚Äôre like me, they cannot break them apart. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of us. We all have different stories, came into the worlds of music and of technology from different angles and different backgrounds.\nI‚Äôll hazard a guess that when you think about the words music and technology together, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre thinking about music technology. This isn‚Äôt surprising, a great deal of music technology surrounds the production, performance, and recording of music. Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), studio recording, guitar pedals, analog control voltage synthesizers, DJ decks, Ableton Live, Max/MSP, Joe Armstrong running Erlang on Sonic Pi‚Ä¶ the list goes on and gets fractally esoteric. All great examples of technology facilitating the art of music, but I‚Äôm interested in what‚Äôs happening the other way around.\nThe original impetus for this post was a comment someone made that raised an eyebrow‚Ä¶ it made me briefly question the ideas I have about the field of resilience in distributed systems somehow relating to music. But humans share such an indisputably organic relationship with music and musical training that I knew I wasn‚Äôt just some crazy person, the connection was there and it was real. How else do I have the job I have now? This pushed me to want to find others that share my views on the close relationship music has with software and operational reliability.\nTake Chloe Condon (Dev Advocate at Microsoft), a self-described recovering musical theatre actress. Now, my musical theatre training and tastes are preeetty specific, but I can relate. She pulls her theatre training into her work unforgivingly, and that is awesome because I fear that. Inspiringly passionate about the connections between her performing arts expertise and working in tech.\nRecently chatting with her at SCaLE, Chloe clued me in about someone close to my wheelhouse: ‚ÄúOpera Singer turned Software Engineer‚Äù Catherine Meyers. Her Mozart could‚Äôve been an Engineer talk correlates music theory and counterpoint to building software. She emphasizes the similarities of pattern recognition between the two disciplines, especially as it relates to learning. Preparing a new piece or constructing a score interpretation is 100% relatable to the software engineer learning a new language or building in a new framework. I especially love how she emphasizes the importance of having different types of minds together in one group, in other words, don‚Äôt be afraid to hire a music major.\nThese folks that are trained in synchronizing common ground through the experience of playing in musical ensembles carry a distinct advantage. Diversity and communication are the trademarks of both successful musical groups and software teams. Establishing common ground through shared learning is crucial to the modern team building and operating distributed software. It is obvious to me that ensemble music not only relates to complex systems but also to highly coordinated teamwork, to wit:\n I\u0026#8217;ve conducted marching bands, wind ensembles, and jazz bands... They are complex, highly interdependent systems. Tanner Lund (SRE at Azure)\n This couldn‚Äôt be more true! I have been in an experimental vocal trio, a free improv quintet, a blues band, a jazz group, an early music ensemble, a 330 piece marching band, uncountable operas with full orchestra and cast, chorales of few to many, piano accompanists by the dozen. There is nothing in any of these situations that doesn‚Äôt require common ground and shared experience.\nIn her blog post, The Origins of Opera and the Future of Programming, Jessica Kerr (Lead Engineer at Atomist) introduces the concept of symmathesy, a state of collaboration that is integrated with learning, all as part of the system (even the tools are team members). She does so by taking us back to the foundations of modern opera in Italy, adeptly adopting the term ‚Äòcamerata‚Äò from the Florentine Camerata example she uses, applying it next to social circles of painters and artists in later centuries, and then to teams creating software. She considers how our mental models evolve and how common ground is reached through the shared experience of a varicolored team from all sorts of different backgrounds, ultimately making the team more powerful. ‚ÄúWe are developing whole new ways of being human together‚Äù she states, and to me, that‚Äôs nowhere more clear than with multi-disciplinary collaboration.\nThe CS / Math / Music crossover is clearly one I have encountered a lot, from early on. While I was studying voice and music technology in undergrad, I vividly remember walking with a good friend in downtown Blacksburg, and her saying to me ‚ÄúI could never major in music, there‚Äôs too much math.‚Äù I used to laugh at this because there‚Äôs really only as much math as that you wish to encounter. Want to dive into tempered tuning and Kepler‚Äôs mathematical ratios for perfect fifths? Go for it. But you know, these days I look at that statement through different lenses. Yes, there is just enough math! And if you study music, you may run the risk of studying computer sciences. _* Please be aware that some practitioners of both have reported sudden bouts of inspiration and lightheadedness due to euphoric discoveries that cross disciplines._\nOn the subject of cross-discipline study‚Ä¶\n I find a lot of what of I learned in music performance transfers directly to public speaking. Amy Tobey (SRE at GitHub)\n As a student of opera, I couldn‚Äôt agree more. Long ago I had a theatre teacher tell me ‚Äúyou will never be happy not onstage.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what she meant until I myself experienced exactly the same kinds of challenges and rewards with giving talks and public speaking as I did singing Mozart or Faur√© in front of large audiences. I discovered that my experiences onstage presenting music are exactly the same headspace as when I‚Äôm talking in front of a room of computer people about distributed systems.\nWhen I gave my talk Measuring Distributed Databases Across the Globe at Southern California Linux Expo 13x (2015), a very enthusiastic artiste-cum-techie approached me afterward. They had decided to move into software engineering after art school and said my talk, which combines theories and ideas in music with those of observing and operating huge distributed databases, was inspiring. They had been trying to reconcile their internal ‚Äòartistic identity and self‚Äô with their passion for coding, and I had opened their eyes to a new way of considering it.\nI will never forget this. It was exactly like having someone come up after one of my experimental music performances (which are also heavy with technology) being blown away and asking how things worked. Even if one mind out of a thousand is influenced by what I‚Äôm doing, whether it‚Äôs music or technology, I‚Äôm building the camerata through sharing.\nEureka! The audience contributes to symmathesy, too. There are tons of examples; the feedback of a crowd during a DJ set, participants of David Tudor‚Äôs Rainforest, someone opening a candy wrapper at the symphony. There‚Äôs no getting away from the audience, however small. John Cage preached throughout his career as an avant-garde composer: listeners are participants. Every performance is something new because there are different people in different places every single time. The title of this piece is a play on Cage‚Äôs Musicircus, an amalgamation of disciplines and performers occupying the same large space together with the audience.\nSo consider the sheer experience of music and how it feels oddly in-step with how we think about technology, and take it one step further. Many of us trained in the practice of music consider it so much a part of our bones that it seeps into our work, we don‚Äôt have a choice, the pattern recognition pathways seem to match up. They fit into our psyches in a comfortable way, share the same affinity for abstractions, incorporate complex and overlapping systems that stretch the human capacity for comprehension.\nDo I have an aptitude for music because I‚Äôm successful in understanding the practical application of complex things? Or do I have an aptitude in technical operations because I have been trained in music and theatre arts? Doesn‚Äôt it make sense that the diversity of music is a human quality, not a disciplinary one? Why should our work as computer scientists, software engineers, database operators, and network gurus be any different?\nTemple Grandin talks about the world needing all kinds of minds. In her view, different people fall amongst three ‚Äúcategories‚Äù of thought: Picture (common on the autistic spectrum), Pattern (code, math, music), and Verbal (writers). It resonates with me a great deal because I always feel like I‚Äôm thinking in ways others are not. More specifically, though, it underlines how different styles of thinking can bring entirely new perspectives on a particular question, and how crucial diversity is to human endeavor, if not evolution itself.\nThis post started out as me being passionate about a subject and wanting to search for others who were. I had some bullet points of my own to insert, but as I searched and connected with others in the field, I learned new things and this blog transformed from a list of Twitter handles to real human relationships. I have grown to understand what Kerr means when she says that ideas are for sharing and collaboration, not hoarding and heroism. I for one am claiming my spot in the camerata that pushes us forward through a New Renaissance.\n",

    "body": "  My job in ops has always been to keep things running. I never considered myself ‚Äúworking in software‚Äù, but have recently begun embracing the fact that I do. What I accomplish as an operations and infrastructure engineer is part of the system, it isn‚Äôt dislocated from its composition.\nRelatedly, I have been considering the nature of the experiment in Chaos Engineering. How continuous verification is becoming a crucial part of the complex systems we build because there really is no end. Developing a software system isn‚Äôt just about writing it, it‚Äôs also every bit as much about running it. Unless there is some kind of evil catastrophic end-game planned from a volcano island hideout, most of us want to keep them running.\nI‚Äôm big on experimental music. You probably know what I mean when I say that, but you might not because genres, in general, are horrible overgeneralizations. Similarly, after the composer John Cage had written his ‚Äúsilent piece‚Äù in 1952 (see also Living 4‚Äô33‚Äù), he seemed to have a struggle with the concept of calling the music composed by him and others he admired experimental.\nIn science, we often think of an experiment as a method to (dis)prove a hypothesis. We perform experiments to answer a question or assertion, often during the process of reaching an end goal. To Cage, this implied that calling something an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù meant it was not complete, not finished. That there is a final state determined by products of the experimentation, and he thought that his (and others‚Äô) music was complete when performed. There was no ‚Äúfinal state‚Äù that was decided as a result of an experiment either succeeding or failing, if it was itself called experimental.\nCage revised this view, however. He began embracing the term and actually ended up preferring it. The reason for this is the way he evolved to think about the context of sound. At the beginning of the decade, he experienced an anechoic chamber (an ‚Äúecholess‚Äù room) and the non-presence of total silence, because he could hear both high and low sounds ‚Äî explained to him by the engineer as his nervous system in operation and blood circulating, respectively. Whether or not that is physiologically probable, he had the now famous revelation that it is impossible to remove sound completely. 4‚Äô33‚Äù and an entire philosophy about the nature of sound and silence in music was not far behind.\nTo him then, the moniker experimental came to mean that which is undiscovered, because even if a piece of music requires certain sounds, environmental sounds are impossible to predict. This experimental music isn‚Äôt about the search for failure or success, but an experience of discovery, where questions become more interesting than answers. When applied to composition, each performance of a musical work is always new and different due to its context and sonic environment. Indeed, it is impossible to know ahead of time any structure of the interpenetrating sounds both intentional and not, themselves independent and unique (whether or not they are consonant). It is in fact in a total state of chaos, each and every time.\nWhen complex systems run, they do so at the hand of indeterminacy and randomness. There certainly is a ‚Äústeady state‚Äù, but it is continuously in need of verification. Just like Cage observing that no performance of a musical work is a repeat, the nature (structure and form) of distributed systems we operate cannot in truth be predicted with any kind of regularity.\nSo while it is useful to be very specific in defining and running our Chaos experiments, the nature of what we‚Äôre doing is more about asking questions and making discoveries, not testing for answers we already think we know or think we can guess. The ‚Äúbreaking things in production‚Äù mantra implies we are interested in failure when what we‚Äôre really interested in is what was determined and what questions arose, good or bad.\nAppendix\nHere are a couple of PDFs taken from Cage‚Äôs writing that highlight his viewpoint on the subject of ‚Äúexperimental music‚Äù as a title of what he did.\n Experimental Music: Doctrine (1955) ::: This article, there titled Experimental Music, first appeared in The Score and I. M. A. Magazine, London, issue of June 1955. The inclusion of a dialogue between an uncompromising teacher and an unenlightened student, and the addition of the word ‚Äùdoctrine‚Äù to the original title, are references to the Huang-Po Doctrine of Universal Mind. Experimental Music (1957) ::: The following statement was given as an address to the convention of the Music Teachers National Association in Chicago in the winter of 1957. It was printed in the brochure accompanying George Avakian‚Äôs recording of my twenty-five-year retrospective concert at Town Hall, New York, in 1958.  The photo above is the album cover from a release by Craque called Meat Hacker.\n",

    "body": "It‚Äôs dead simple. Focus on your team and product.\n  Yes! An easy tweetable answer! Except that it‚Äôs loaded with questions and assumptions. Instead, what I will talk about here are technology decisions. Those that really matter are about things that elevate your ability to build what you are building at the velocity you need.\nIn Operations and SRE, we are not only tasked with evaluating and testing technologies, we are often requested (or sometimes instructed) to support the decisions others make. This isn‚Äôt an ideal situation, and in some cases, impractical because it feels like a policing. In fact, it might sound a little selfish to think that SRE needs the ability to say ‚Äúyay‚Äù or ‚Äúnay‚Äù to a decision. If you think that feels slightly siloed, you‚Äôd be right. I prefer working with all vested parties to come up with a solution that fits the problem, not just make blind leaps of faith on a particular platform. Flexibility and cooperative evaluation work really really well, believe it or not.\nIn my experience, it takes a minimum of six months for a team to work up a brand new (to them) technology or platform and have it be supportable in production. Even then, if the software team building it won‚Äôt be permanently oncall for it (which is something else I believe), they should at least be on the hook for a minimum of six months further as the kinks are worked out. This seems fairly straightforward for something like a development framework or a particular platform specific to operating the software system in question. For example, adopting Redis as a DBRE-supported platform in production. There are clear reasons why the software needs this kind of ultraspeedy k/v store, and building up widespread support in SRE for it means other software teams benefit. That is a highly opinionated decision and one that‚Äôs fairly easy to make especially because it‚Äôs free!\nBut is it? In contrast, what happens when you need to fulfill the needs of infrastructure? This is where Operations tires really hit the road. This doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a siloed decision, for example introspecting the system is as important to reliability engineering as it is to the folks developing the software. The Redis example above shows how technology decisions become a crucial part of the collaboration among everyone involved building your product, whether it be dev or sec or ops or everything in-between. However, it doesn‚Äôt quite reflect the reality of infrastructure requirements, particularly tooling that supports the needs of reliability. ‚ÄúWe need monitoring and we need it yesterday!‚Äù\nSo, I posit: There is no ‚ÄúBuild or Buy‚Äù. There is only Buy.\n  I build electronic instruments. My product is the music I make, and one the central philosophies in my approach to improvisation and performance is the concept of ‚Äúoriginal sound‚Äù. What music does a plucked cactus make when amplified, or how can a mercury tilt-switch and photoresistor create sound from electrons? The top picture here is of a breadboard, a prototype of a device that will eventually drive something called a ‚ÄúVoltage Controlled Oscillator‚Äù, or VCO. To the left is a photo of a professionally designed, tested, and built VCO. I have no need to design and build a VCO, even though fun, it is a distraction ‚Äì both in time and money ‚Äì from my main purpose: the creation of a new kind of analog synthesizer controller. I‚Äôd rather buy the VCO and the accompanying support of the experts who not only built it but are passionate about its success. Then I can focus resources on my creativity.\nThe technology decision to be made is heavily informed by what kinds of resources you want to spend on it. Building a platform in-house, using your own people, is sometimes only feasible with very large companies that have the ability to staff for this, and often have custom circumstances. It‚Äôs not hard to notice that a few very successful software platforms come out of organizations in this position. These teams also must deal with all the infrastructure costs, maintenance, reliability, and complex aggregations of data and transports. These problems have indeed been solved many times over by third party SaaS/PaaS/IaaS solutions, but sometimes the amount of customization required demands it. Or the development of these systems may be so clearly aligned with the company objectives that it is a non-question (e.g. Netflix pioneering Chaos Engineering or Google producing Borg/Kubernetes).\nThese days, such cases are the exceptions. Most of us are with companies where this luxury and concentration of engineering ability aren‚Äôt present. It may make a ton more sense to choose an expert in the field, whose company mission is specifically to provide this need. The argument that Ops Is A Cost Center is underlined, because the focus should really be on the product. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre good enough we can run a custom log aggregation stack at the same time we‚Äôre developing this completely dependent but orthogonally related product‚Äù is probably an approach that should be questioned, unless of course you are prepared to buy those resources through hiring and operational expenses.\nEither way, you‚Äôre building something. Recall the decision to choose Redis, and how long it took to enable that system in production. The same will apply to any in-house platform or tooling. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs a tradeoff. To buy resources for building in-house or buy a third party SaaS, each have their own layers of complexity, complication, and frustration. Yep, it might be fun to build, but is embarking on such a project really the right choice for the team and the product?\nLike many in Ops, I once considered the ‚ÄúElastic Search / Logstash / Kabana‚Äù (aka ELK) stack for datacenter log aggregation. All its various pieces are a fun complex thing to put together, and it‚Äôs an extremely useful resource for gathering and displaying events. All these pieces are freely available things, but our SRE teams were already pretty busy with the task of running our own product and other custom bits of infrastructure. It would take at least a single SRE‚Äôs full time and attention to keep the stack running across multiple server farms of 10,000+ nodes. Not to mention training and documentation for others. Maintained, tested, resilience-hardened, budgeted, the list goes on. I‚Äôm definitely going to be ‚Äúbuying‚Äù a lot here, and it‚Äôs a messy looking BOM. ELK‚Äôs competitors at the time ranged from fairly entry-level cloud-based SaaS to ‚ÄúEnterprise‚Äù packages, but one vendor, in particular, would be a great solution. Was there a cost and the administrative toil of negotiating a contract and keeping a vendor relationship going? Yep. It‚Äôs also a single invoice, takes much less time from the SRE team to manage, and is much simpler to integrate with the farm.\nWould you rather focus on building the instrumentation into your software and have a team of external experts guide, consult, and ultimately provide the intelligence platform to which they have dedicated their careers? Or would you rather split focus and build your own customizations into the infrastructure? It‚Äôs not black and white, either. One method may outweigh the other depending on whether you‚Äôre bare-metal or in the cloud. There may be security reasons to do one over the other. As the software product matures, these needs may blur. What needs to be bought may be simple and small or complex and large, and grow in either direction.\nSo let‚Äôs be clear: a third party platform isn‚Äôt automatically ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù than creating an equally performant service or fulfill a particular infrastructure reliability need in-house. Do the research and compare, make the investment that makes the most sense for your team.\nDon‚Äôt be fooled, though. Either way, you‚Äôre buying it.\n",

    "body": "I haven‚Äôt experienced Mute‚Äôs STUMM433 release yet, it‚Äôs not due out until May. The proceeds from its sale go to charities, so that‚Äôs a big huge plus for it already. Pulling big names like Depeche Mode and Moby will hopefully make for good sales.\nThis is also not the first time 4‚Äô33‚Äù has been ‚Äúrecorded‚Äù for the purpose of a record release and not as part of a live performance. Frank Zappa has done it, Pauline Oliveros and the Deep Listening Band plus others, and some even got sued for it. However, this tweet from the John Cage Trust, of all places, put me on guard:Depeche Mode, Moby to Cover John Cage‚Äôs Silent ‚Äò4‚Äô33‚Ä≥‚Äò https://t.co/KaFADRCDsX via @RollingStone \u0026mdash; John Cage Trust (@JohnCageTrust) \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/JohnCageTrust/status/1086301086678429696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\u0026quot;\u0026gt;January 18, 2019\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;    Immediately, I think‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcover‚Äù? How? What is this photo?\nSo once I start looking into this, I learn about the accompanying videos. The Laibach one featured on the Mute website (which cleverly includes a shot of the Cramps Caged/Uncaged homage from 2000) is a kind of short silent film. I imagine many (if not all) of the other videos will be similar. So it‚Äôs telling that they refer to it as a ‚Äúcover‚Äù and use words like ‚Äúinterpolation‚Äù to describe this collection.\nThe terminology now makes sense to me. These are not performances of the original score, but takes on Cage‚Äôs own expansion of the idea that it could be performed as anything, at any time, for any duration (like the versions of 0‚Äô00‚Äù from Song Books). Presenting an alternative action during the ‚Äúsilence‚Äù of a representative version of 4‚Äô33‚Äù is not so much a reading of the score as it is an interpenetration of events. Which is fine, even enjoyable. Nevertheless, the very idea of 4‚Äô33‚Äù in the popular eye is surrounded in jokes and doubt, so it is ironically funny to think that a recording imparts the same sort of wonder that a live experience of it does.\nSpoiler: it doesn‚Äôt.\nIn addition to witnessing it several times, I performed 4‚Äô33‚Äù at my undergraduate recital (on classical guitar!). Let me tell you‚Ä¶ it is much more than just the sounds around you and what leaks in. It is a visceral experience that isn‚Äôt captured in a recording, where the very best of intentions can only pay tribute to the surreal actuality of sitting there, enduring the seconds as nothing happens. The tension in the audience is very VERY real. Sometimes funny, sometimes raucous, but regardless the performer must stay focussed. There is simply nothing that gives the work the heft that Mute describes without experiencing it firsthand.\nAs a kind of funny postscript‚Ä¶ when I was near the end of my time in grad school, where I rigorously studied voice and Cage‚Äôs music, I was asked to participate in a production of Theater Piece, a work of simultaneous but unrelated events. Somehow, CF Peters (the sole publishers of Cage‚Äôs scores) heard of this production, that I was involved, and assuming me responsible tracked me down to demand royalties be paid for staging the piece.

    "title": "Musical Intuition meet Technology and Chaos",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " Today I read through the InfoQ eMag on Chaos Engineering, and was struck by John Allspaw‚Äôs (@allspaw) contribution because it reminded me of something I jotted down on a sticky at my desk a few days ago:\n Intuition is valid because it is learned like jazz changes.  I‚Äôm pretty stubborn and refuse to accept that music is merely a hobby of mine. When people ask me if electronic music or singing is my ‚Äúhobby‚Äù, I am wincing inside. So a question often on my mind is: how does the intuition I have when performing and composing music connect with the work I do as a technologist?\nSome musicological background might help. One concept in learning how to improvise (jazz or otherwise) is that you have developed an intuition built around internalizing the materials and form of the piece (or genre) ‚Äì like scales, chord changes, or rhythm structures. This is different from the more lizard-brainy concept of instinct. Think about a blues progression, the foundation of music you hear every day, everywhere. You know intuitively the chord progression and timing is ‚Äúright‚Äù, even so much that anomalies and departures come across as emotionally significant. The rest is pop history.\nBut you, homo sapiens, do not have this chord sequence pre-programed¬†in your DNA, it isn‚Äôt something that is instinctual. By the same token, great technology leaders develop good intuition (expertise over hundreds of interviews) when hiring engineers but never rely on instinct (oh I just have a good ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù). The best DBAs have an intuitive understanding of their platform (you want to do X, but did you think of Y+Z?), but there‚Äôs nothing instinctual about it.\nIt is not a stretch, then, to recognize that intuition in improvised music can be directly compared to how Allspaw writes about the ‚Äúmental map‚Äù that engineers develop. They each have their own subjective view on relevant (but overlapping) parts of the system and are challenged when relating each substrate to theirs. For instance, a phenomenon known as ‚Äúfundamental common-ground breakdown‚Äù (Woods \u0026amp; Klein: Common¬†Ground¬†and¬†Coordination¬†in¬†Joint¬†Activity) happens when what I describe as intuitions (accumulated individual learnings about the system) are assumed knowledge among participants, good or bad. Part of the game is learning how to harmonize these separate threads of experience, avoiding costly coordination surprise and re-synchronization‚Ä¶ and trust me, I have been in plenty of rehearsals and narrowly saved performances that fit this description!\nThe important point here is that a system becomes more complex as it grows dimensions, shrinking the capacity of any one person to comprehend the whole thing. Therefore we rely on shared and discovered knowledge to fully grok these fascinating systems. Take any ensemble of musicians:¬†as it grows in membership, individuals gradually lose the ability to contain its myriad relationships in their mental map, so coordination and integration become a matter of listening and rehearsal experience (both modes of communication). Oh and it characterizes the music, too. Building intuition about how to play a part in an opera is much different than in a free improv vocal trio. Orchestrating ten thousand linux containers in a cloud provider doesn‚Äôt compare to managing two rows of server racks at the datacenter downtown.\nTechnologists grapple with the task of building and sharing intuitions about a system because understanding an entire system contributes to what we know about making it more resilient. Communication is key in either musical or engineering teams, collaboration on understanding the whole is no exception. Our mental maps should be adaptable to constant updates, and practices like Chaos Engineering that make discoveries in complex system behavior are supported by this kind of cross-pollination and proliferation of our combined understanding.\nA quote from Allspaw‚Äôs article highlights it well:\n Maybe the process of designing a chaos experiment is just as valuable as the actual performance of the experiment. ‚Äì John Allspaw, Recalibrating Mental Models through Design of Chaos Experiments\n The use of the term ‚Äúperformance‚Äù is apt. We‚Äôre familiar with this concept: practice makes perfect. Taken further, the experience of practice is necessary such that the result is merely an extension of practice. It takes meticulous work to understand a piece of music to the level of having an intuition about how it operates, and the same goes for building experimentation that challenges what you think you know about complex software. The results of the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù can be enhanced by a focus on understanding the system‚Äôs design and steady state (i.e. nominal condition), what we would call the language of the musical work. It is as if the performance of the event naturally evolves from learnings gained preparing for it.\nImagine you are a jazz musician, you have gone through years of studying scales and changes and charts and recordings of a particular artist, and have built a capability for understanding how the language of their music works. One evening at a local club, your dreams are fulfilled, you‚Äôre in the audience and invited up for a set with them. You intuitively know how this person plays their music, as it has been a guide for your own. But when you‚Äôre jamming together, they do something indeterminately that informs your intuition in a way you would have never discovered yourself. Not only has the process of designing your inevitable collaboration been valuable to understand what you thought you needed to know to play like your biggest influence, but it also served as the basis for learning something new and unexpected.\nWhether it is free improvisation or interpreting a through-composed piece of music (and everything in between), there is a certain amount of experience and training informing the performance. Eventually, when we‚Äôve practiced enough, the music itself steps out of the way and intuition takes over. I think this is where my musical performance connection with technology starts: once you understand the fundamentals of the system, let the presentation of the system get out of the way, and you‚Äôre in a better place to evolve your mental map and gain further intuition through disciplines like Chaos Engineering.\n",

    "title": "Successful Tech Teams and the Superb DJ Set",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " The term disc jockey was first coined in 1935, referring of course to the phonograph discs that had become popular for recorded music. Forty years and dozens of musical genre shifts later, the Technics SL-1200 direct drive paved the way for turntablists, still concerned with round artifacts of engraved sound, but doing more live manipulation than just selecting and playing tunes.\nSince then, it has come to signify any presentation of recorded music mixed for a listening audience. Drum machines and synthesizers snuck their way into the mix as hip-hop and house music were invented. The use of vinyl record ‚Äúdiscs‚Äù morphed into Compact Discs and even cassette tapes and reel-to-reel mixing. Eventually, this led the activity of ‚ÄúDJing‚Äù into the most widespread application today: digital files played by any variety of control surfaces, from none at all to touch surfaces to spinning metal platters to full vinyl replicants that signaled transport controls to the playback system storing the file.\nBuilding a set is another responsibility of DJing that is done in all kinds of different ways, with all kinds of different music, in all kinds of environments and settings. Whether you‚Äôre a radio DJ performing to an unknown audience or at a club holding up the dancefloor, there is an elegant methodology of diversity involved. Even when it‚Äôs a prescribed style, a lot of preparation goes into the Superb DJ Set.\nWhat makes the Superb Set? I divide ‚Äúthe work of a DJ‚Äù into four basic categories:\n The homework of selection. What do I like or want/need to include? (materials) The spectrum of choice. What tracks make sense with what other tracks? (methods) The environment of creation. What is the setting and acoustics? (form) The flow of performance. What happens controlled in real time? (structure)  Regardless of medium (disc or no disc), DJs accomplish each step in different ways depending on who they are. It always involves the collection strategies, stylistic tastes, requirements of the event, attention to form and/or/not structure, personal goals (musical or professional), and the audience itself. The DJ may be a completely free improviser, an experimental sound artist, a wedding MC, a techno junkie, an EDM opportunist, a desert party space explorer, a masterful breakbeat juggler, or an underground house magician. I believe they all include some version of each of these categories.\nReady for this? The same tenets apply to building a Successful Technology Team. Compare:\n Homework. Who do I want or need to include on this team? Spectrum. Who has the right balance of talent that makes sense on this team? Environment. What are the requirements of the business? Flow. How does the team interact, collaborate, and ultimately deliver?  Just like the diverse history of DJs and music, tech teams span a vast range of expertise and function, not to mention approaches to organization. I‚Äôm talking about everything from day-to-day (or should I say, sprint-to-sprint) Agile teams and purpose-built developer tiger teams to ‚ÄúT-shaped engineers‚Äù on multi-functional operations teams and necessarily heterogeneous IT departments. Each of these individuals are like specific tracks on a record, the pieces of music themselves, expertly selected and set into sympathetic vibration and choreographing their own results. The audience is not only the customer but also product managers and project coordinators (not unlike event producers and organizers), and many other parts of the technology business.\nIn fact, where the DJ and the Technology Leader (let‚Äôs call them a ‚ÄòTL‚Äô) really intersect is diversity in construction and release of control. For example, the homework of the DJ might be crate digging or further exploration of known things online. The TL has the homework of digging into the talent pool and recognizing what they want or need on the team. Both are fraught with mistakes and hidden gems. The DJ selects a diverse spectrum of tracks to mix, while the TL should espouse diversity among teammates mixed together. The DJ‚Äôs venue is analogous to the TL‚Äôs workplace, what is needed not by the music/team but what shapes the work they do. Flow from track to track and section to section is no different from the team‚Äôs ongoing efforts to work together, match each others‚Äô strengths, and support each others‚Äô weaknesses.\nThe resultant similarity between a Superb Set and a Successful Tech Team is not really a tenet as much as it is the desired effect: the DJ/TL steps back and lets the music/team combine and take control. Once the DJ has prepared their set, when it is in full swing and engaging whatever audience, specific control is lost. External forces ‚Äì like the energy of the dance floor, requests made by listeners, anomalies and failures in the sound system itself, or even just a scratch in the record ‚Äì indeterminately affect the materials, structure, and flow. The Superb DJ is ready for these challenges, to help guide both the rules under which they operate and the engagement of participants involved to a harmonious and fulfilling goal.\nIf that‚Äôs not like building and running a great team, I don‚Äôt know what is. We deal daily with interruptions and unknowns in running software on distributed networks. Humans are humans, and like scratches in records, they can cause mild-to-severe issues within the team. Requests made by product (or other) managers can interrupt, company events will necessarily intertwine, and unforeseen losses of momentum and energy can mean nobody is dancing anymore.\nSometimes as a DJ I will buy a record because I like the sound or the album art or even just the composer‚Äôs name, only to find that its BPM doesn‚Äôt match anything I own, or its sound is too harsh to really use in a public setting. It is why it is crucial not to only consider one of the four tenets, but to carry the desire for something great as a thread through each phase of the approach. Intuition is good, but also including close evaluation and clear decision making is better. In that sense, careful listening and observation is as important in musical interpretation as it is managing diverse human personalities and lifting them be successful technology leaders themselves. It might be true that everyone is a DJ because they can just ‚Äúpress play‚Äù, but the Superb Set ‚Äì and the Successful Tech Team ‚Äì is the reachable dream.\n",

    "title": "LA Phil graces Cage‚Äôs Europeras 1 & 2",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": " John Cage liked to borrow. Whether in musical style or approach to theatre, the materials themselves are often not his. Musical scores evolved into graphic iconography or instruction governed by brackets of time and/or duration. Written pieces were amalgamations, mesostics ‚Äúwritten through‚Äù other authors‚Äô work, or more ‚Äúcut-up‚Äù style constructions of various texts.\nIt applied to his philosophies, too. He is known to take bits and pieces of Eastern practice and weave their concepts into his worldview and compositional process. Concepts like the Huayan Buddhist ‚Äúinterpenetration‚Äù of all things were slightly bent by Cage, who found them useful for composing, but maybe slightly ignoring (or denying) any inherent interconnectedness.\nSuch synergy is often attributed to improvisation, like a jazz combo. On the contrary, Cage was very much about the accidental interpenetration of elements by downplaying any relationship importance between them at all. The idea of ‚Äúplaying off each other‚Äù as if playing jazz was not allowed, simply because it wasn‚Äôt scored that way.\nThese were simply concurrent events that coincided in layers against each other, necessarily connected by nothing but the experience, indeterminate and interpenetrating. It seems to imply chaos, and that is precisely how my wife described the LA Phil west coast premiere of Europeras 1 \u0026amp; 2 to me afterward: ‚Äútoo much going on for your brain to comprehend‚Äù and ‚Äúthe weirdest thing you‚Äôve taken me to yet.‚Äù\nNow that‚Äôs saying something! We‚Äôve participated in Long Beach SoundWalk multiple years, we‚Äôve seen some outrageous installations and concerts. Even my music is pretty damn strange. Whether or not this actually hit the tip of the Weirdometer, there was one thing we agreed upon: nothing was happening, and everything was happening.\nMy wife and I have never been to a movie studio lot, so it was a new experience just arriving and finding our way back through the closely stacked identical warehouses to Studio 23. The Sunday matinee crowd fascinated us. We guessed the throng held Cage fans, opera fans, music students, season ticket pass holders and supporters of LA Phil, friends of the cast and orchestra, and even scattered fashionistas.\nInside was a simple proscenium stage configuration, the audience rising up and back, fly loft and everything built into this huge soundstage. On each side of the main stage were three columns of orchestra, with most major instruments represented at least once. The stage itself was an 8√ó8 grid, marked with numbers 1-64 to represent hexagrams of the I Ching, which itself is used to drive the chance operations required for creating the performance based on Cage‚Äôs score.\nThe distinction of 1 \u0026amp; 2 is a programmatic one, they have always been performed together as a 90 + 45 minute show. So we settled in for a good bit of nothing we ever expected. Although I have never seen the Europera scores first hand, I have performed many other Cage pieces that revolve around the same concept: time brackets of performed material according to decisions arrived through chance operations. Many of his scores like this were performed simultaneously, so that not only did each individual composition interpenetrate with itself, it also did with the other piece.\nThe Europeras are a culmination of this approach by Cage, and not only because they are among the last works he composed before his death in 1992. Chance procedures determine every aspect of the production, from costuming and scenery to blocking and the placement of arias selected from the standard repertoire. In the midst, selections from Truckera (a tape of 101 layered European opera fragments) were broadcast stereoscopically across loudspeakers above the audience, giving the sonic illusion a ‚Äútruck of opera‚Äù was rattling by the performance and drowning everything out.\nThe entire work becomes a brilliant collage of sight, sound, dimension, and movement. There are entirely mind-bending Fluxus moments of absurdity, subtle sequences of sublime beauty, and a good amount of unintended comedy.\nThe LA Phil performance mostly held true to Cage‚Äôs intent. There were dancers moving independently of both scrim- and prop-based scenery (also sequenced with chance operations), but also acting as stagehands and crew to move things around. Very seldom it starts to drift, as when these same dancers become engaged with the opera singers in their individual scenes.\nI have to hand it to the singers in this production. It is not hyperbole to state that seeing this performed is at the top of my bucket list. These folks were charged with non-traditional blocking, ignoring every other musical cue they hear around them while staying in-tune as possible, having to watch the large count-up clocks posted on each precipice of the stage, navigate indeterminately moving scenery and other actors, all while performing a fully committed aria wearing costuming and performing blocking both separately derived by chance operations and completely unrelated to the entire way they were taught to interpret an aria.\nSome did this better than others. One of the more successful sang ‚ÄúOh du, mein holder Abendstern‚Äù from Wagner‚Äôs Tannh√§user, outfitted in full astronaut garb (minus helmet), the entire time both lying and moving around a hospital bed, while any number of other arias, scene changes, and lighting queues happened around him. I found it masterfully performed against a magnificent bed of chaos.\nMany of the singers‚Äô performances were like this. As was the orchestra. There was an incredible amount of commitment in this show that is absolutely vital to Cage‚Äôs music. The entire ensemble ‚Äì from stage crew and props to performers and designers ‚Äì dialed in on this aspect of performing Cage and it comes through.\nLighting queues and design were scored completely separately as well, often focussing on the audience, into the ceiling of the warehouse, across the back of the building behind the open stage area. Scrim backgrounds, some looking quite ancient, dropped at various elevations, frequently covering an entire ‚Äúscene‚Äù behind it due to the chance operations involved. Sometimes individually numbered squares onstage were illuminated, amorphous areas of color appeared, and more than once a strange ladder descended made entirely of what appeared to be fluorescent rods.\nSopranos galloping on life-size fake horses carried by dancers, a baritone singing (Mozart?) while preparing a steak on a hot plate with chopped vegetables, a tenor in drag performing what I think was from Rake‚Äôs Progress (Stravinsky), the Toreador Song (from Carmen) staged to a commercial being filmed for hair products. Some scenes had no singing at all, like the baritone who sunbathed in 70s garb for what seemed like an eternity before he finally got up and sang a short aria. Or the girl backward in a running belt vibration machine drinking a coke with a straw in a full Wizard-of-Oz Dorothy outfit (complete with ruby slippers) and maybe sang, but maybe didn‚Äôt. Or the soprano auctioning off small statues to members of the orchestra, complete with gavel banging.¬†Yoga and Queen of the Night, I think it was?\nExcept in one rare case where a tuba belted out Flight of the Valkyries, the orchestral parts were not as immediately recognizable as the arias, but equally enjoyable in the mix of it all. I especially loved interjections from percussion, like sudden cybals and tympani. The effect of this differentiated musical tissue was like an extended meditation on simultaneous sound against a landscape that was constantly in motion.\nOverall, Europera 1 was more recognizable for me and felt like it breathed with long sequences, wonderful moments of silence where the HVAC in the huge studio warehouse took its solos, combinations of the orchestra that did not feel at all chance-derived, and I felt drawn in the entire time. Europera 2 felt more compressed, more frenetic, maybe more immediately interesting but definitely more chaotic. Nevertheless, it ultimately wasn‚Äôt as memorable as the first, and yet felt more voluminous and energetic. Even the chance-derived synopses (related to nothing) reflect this telescopic pattern:\n 1\n He falls deeply in love with a beautiful streetsinger who staggers into the hut. He buys a love potion. Her candle goes out and impressed by his wealth she decides to marry him on the spot. The would reveals that after three years he will have himself crowned Emperor with the evil one‚Äôs help in exchange for his love. At first she flees; whereupon he gathers all his strength, she becomes passionately attached and begs a hermit‚Äôs refuge.\n 2\n She sells his soul to her father with the aim of improving his impaired finances. Even her loving relatives are shocked. They rescue him. He retires. She agrees. Torn, they, in shame, pardon all conspirators. He agrees to marry her. She kills herself. He is chosen the victor.\n After the final curtain¬†dropped at precisely the correct time, we left the soundstage, the sun barely setting as we found our way out of Culver City. I reflected on how difficult it is to convey the real power in this category of Cage‚Äôs compositions without experiencing them firsthand, live and in person. In addition to the power of simply listening and seeing, his works of this kind express a sort of pandemonium that is at the same time masterfully controlled and undoubtedly a ‚Äúwork by Cage‚Äù: meticulously crafted experiences in anarchy.\n",

    "title": "The Shocking Before and After of Remoteness",
    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "I was once employed at a startup whose attitude about remote workers had begun to retrograde to the point where even simple tolerance of the practice became a hot point. Leadership was known to stroll through offices and make comments about how they didn‚Äôt see butts in seats, even frequenting some facilities on early morning Fridays just to scoff at the emptiness of the expansive ‚Äúopen floor plans‚Äù where interruptions and distractions were kept at a maximum. Human Resources went as far as to craft a strict remote worker policy, and included a very unpopular (and I think ultimately struck down) requirement of being in the office during ‚Äúbanking hours‚Äù. Multiple times, as both a senior engineer and hiring manager, I hit roadblocks with remote employee hires ‚Äì really good ones.¬†In fact, working from home became a privilege that had to be approved at the executive level.\nHard to believe I‚Äôm talking about a startup in the 21st century, isn‚Äôt it?\nIn¬†Remote Worker: A Primer¬†I gave an introduction to my rich history as a remote employee and included some tips on how teams can make it successful. So as egregious as this all sounds, I would rather move beyond the ranting and finger-pointing. I want to talk about health.\nSoon after leaving said company, I happened to mention to a close friend on IRC about how my gastro-intestinal problems seemed to have subsided since I left. To my surprise, he mentioned exactly the same thing happening after a similar experience and then said a friend of his also made the same comment after leaving a stressful company situation. We were all victims of being in distress and not understanding why. Frankly, I thought it was tomato sauce.\nSo yeah, stress is weird. You cannot always identify it, sometimes until it‚Äôs too late, or when its sources have disappeared. It physically manifests in the weirdest places, so that you feel like you must be wrong in some other way‚Ä¶ how could what seems like only an extreme mental condition cause such extreme physical distress?\nI first recognized this effect when a manager (not my supervisor) at different startup came up to me to rail about some random technology decision, I can‚Äôt even remember what it was. The change was Hulk-like. I immediately flushed, I could feel the heat rising to my head, my ears start itching, eyes water. This person leaves after 5 minutes of ranting at me and I look down and I‚Äôm literally covered in hives.\nI also used to have long, work-related nightmares featuring whatever employee or edict was brightest in my cranial heat-map at the time, and my feet would start intensely itching while I slept. The next morning I awoke covered in hives. This constant nagging of the itching would put me into weird fugue states where my mind was making strange abstract logic connections to my physical state, holding me in this kind of cognitive limbo where I wasn‚Äôt deeply sleeping but nowhere near awake, and not dreaming.\n‚Äì\nSo I finally jumped.\nI decided to take control of my career. For too many years after the first ‚ÄúDotCom Bubble Burst‚Äù, I felt like I was faking it. Good at what I set myself out to accomplish, but ultimately held back by one ceiling or another. Not always, but often enough, times felt rough and constantly churning under the whim of forces I could not control. I wanted to be an influencer and craft things, expand my learning, and contribute to the Earth.\nInnovating technology work on a small, highly senior, and highly intelligent remote engineering team was exactly what my body needed. For the first time in years, I am regularly getting a good night‚Äôs sleep. Surprising considering the intensity of work and entire estates of new knowledge that I am now experiencing.\nIt may not seem obvious, but I discovered part of my stress was actually anticipating the alarm going off in the morning. I don‚Äôt need to make a train departure time for a 90-minute commute, the morning ritual is not rushed and haphazard, but I maintain it. I feel human waking up in the morning, and ready to conquer (no small amount of thanks to my spouse and partner in life, because our tiny house has now become my tiny office, too).\nLook, I barely have room in my psyche to handle the anxiety of my personal world, much less my professional one. When there is stress on both sides, they feed off each other, self-amplifying in a torrential loop, difficult to break. Getting to a place where I can be myself and completely kick ass at what I do gives me the strength to handle stressful situations and not be stressed about them.\nThe chronic GI problems I used to have are no longer. I‚Äôve lost weight. I get hives only from real allergies, physical things I can avoid (although you can argue I now eschew the mental ones as well). My relationships are closer, and it is invigorating to feel more connected to my local community. I‚Äôve been energized to finish DIY builds and even record new things. Plus, I finally feel like I can make room ‚Äì in time and thought ‚Äì to write.\n",

I lived in the northern suburbs of DC, worked as a graveyard shift unix system administrator at a datacenter company called Digex, and hosted a radio show for two years while I studied in graduate school as a vocal student and specialist in experimental vocal music and opera performance. These were also the years I was heavily entrenched in the mid-Atlantic free improvisation and experimental avant-garde music and noise scene.\nAs an undergrad I hosted an early morning (6-9am) show on WUVT that was all about experimental music and jazz, something the station didn‚Äôt have, and wanted to carry that tradition on in grad school. Naturally, it was at the U of Maryland that I hosted an experimental music radio show on WMUC, called ‚ÄúMother of Invention‚Äù.\nThe notebook flips between esoteric sysadmin notes, network architecture doodles, scribbled passwords and my radio playlists from the show.

    "body": "I am the nerd who annoyed you as a roommate because I always had the phone line busy dialing into BBSes when you were pounding cheap beer to ‚Äújump up jump up and get down‚Äù in the living room, while I searched Usenet for pirated software and other nefarious files, loving the thrill of connecting to a different reality.\nI am the music major geek at a largely engineering-focussed university that sat for hours at the library VAX/VMS amber-toned terminal using raw telnet to log into MUDs and MOOs, attempting RPG challenges, having ‚Äúvirtual sex‚Äù and all other kinds of things, collaborating on tracks, partying together as a community IRL, and creating some of the strongest friendships I have today.\nI am the underground file sharing maven, exploring an entire world of both listening to and creating music that I only know through meeting people on Hotline and IRC. It‚Äôs also very likely I would have never experienced fly fishing without them.\nOne day while working on the music department gopher server on an Apple LC running MacBSD, I learned about the ‚Äútalk‚Äù command, and was amazed that such an operating system could connect me directly to someone on a computer in the UK. Even though I had been on MUD/MOO and BBS for years, I remember it making a big impression on me. It gave me a sense of independent worldliness, where I did not need any one of these tools to communicate immediately with people across the globe. I glimpsed a world of opportunity unfolding before me.\nGetting into BSD got me into ACM, among even more people who spent the majority of their social life as avatars that comprised a ‚Äúcyber self‚Äù. There was no Facebook, no graphical social media at all. Even so, throughout all these online platforms, I began to think of myself also inhabiting a ‚Äúcyber world‚Äù in addition to the analog world. Not only that, as I spent more and more time online, my typing got better and better! I absolutely account my strong typing skills to being so involved in text-based social networks. There is an inherent creativity in needing to use only words to communicate, Twitter‚Äôs character limitation always reminds me of an early high school English assignment to ‚Äúwrite an entire story in one sentence‚Äù.\nIndeed, I got my real start in my current career by being heavily involved in these tools. From the very beginning, the idea of being remote and collaborating with people in different locations and time zones has been ingrained in my work approach. This style of communication became a distinct part of me. Not only were programming languages important, but so was an attention to human language itself. I already wrote a lot of poetry, so the transition to interactive wordsmithing was not too far a jump. At AOL, where I worked in a real office but remote to HQ (then in Virginia), you were considered ‚Äúin the office‚Äù by being present on AIM.\nThis isn‚Äôt to say there aren‚Äôt face-to-face interactions. This is a crucial part of making remote employees work, there has to be some intersection of in-person human contact. This could be weekly or monthly or more, but in my experience even a one-time visit with a remote collaborator/employee/colleague/friend can make a universe of difference in understanding how to work with them. You‚Äôll notice in my lineage as a ‚Äúcyber personality‚Äù I often mention in-person interactions, it is always an important part of it, even though it may not happen very often (that said, I have known people who were married online without ever having met in-person).\nCompanies where I‚Äôve been employed have always had a mixture of in-office and remote, and while some do it naturally and consider it a core value, others cannot seem to gain any consistency. Regardless of whether it‚Äôs a nearly 100% remote situation, multiple offices separated by both distance and time zone, or a small population of great employees external to headquarters, the company culture must embrace it.\nOne enemy of this approach is the ‚Äúopen floor plan‚Äù, which is closely related to the other enemy: _unintentional locality_. When a team is distributed, the entire team needs to be a part of what the team discusses and decides. When there are concentrations of that team in any one place, there is a tendency to make decisions and communicate planning to only those who are local. In database operations, we call this ‚Äúsplit brain‚Äù, and it can have catastrophic results; one hand doesn‚Äôt know what the other is doing, even if it‚Äôs the same thing.\nAnything at all that feels like a team-wide thing should be taken to your distributed team tool set. I‚Äôve found that it feels much more natural to default to this behavior if you also socialize on the same tools. Just like you‚Äôd joke around or share some knowledge in person, do it in chat. Make it a habit that it‚Äôs the first place you turn. In fact, I have even found that text-based chat tools surmount language barriers. There are former colleagues of mine who spoke terrible English, but had a much better command of it when typing, so I would much prefer having a conversation in chat than otherwise.\nI might be a special case because I have been insufflated with the concept of working with people remotely since before the ‚Äúweb‚Äù even existed. Nevertheless, I believe it can be a learned skill, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be entirely chat-based either. Collaborative video and whiteboard solutions exist nowadays as well. Regardless of the tool, what it does take is commitment to making it work, threading it into your company culture and not treat remote employees as exceptions that become a second thought. The first thought should be: how are we making sure we‚Äôre inclusive and communicating well?\nWhat will happen if you don‚Äôt do this? Remote workers will feel unloved, uninformed, and cut off. You will lose good people and not be able to hire more. The perceived trouble with communicating with them actually extends from not planning on supporting that style of communication from the beginning. I would go as far as making this part of the interview process, even on the job description. Underline that collaboration with remote workers is necessary and required, and the company supports this paradigm as part of its culture.\nIn at least one case I have witnessed a company go the opposite direction. Praise was handed down multiple times that the advantage they had was that everyone was under one roof, and agile teams can work more closely together. This attitude went un-checked and un-corrected, which gives remote workers ‚Äì even in large remote offices ‚Äì the feeling of exclusion. There must have been some sense that a successful distributed company will ‚Äújust work‚Äù by nature of it already containing remote workers, but that‚Äôs not enough. You have to go the extra mile to make it happen, you must foster a culture of inclusion and respect for remote employees. This is one thing you cannot half-ass and ‚Äújust see if it works out‚Äù; commit to it working, and it will.\n",

    "body": "Probably around five years ago now, while much further in the depths of a thrice-laid-off financial hole the technology industry bestowed upon me, I became fixated with actually building my own electronic instruments. Ensuing the expertise to make music that way, I departed into the wide unknown universe of DIY audio.\nThe first time I encountered a small, personal modular synthesizer was during a long gallery installation and collaborative work by Achim Wollscheid¬†in Chicago (I also happened to have given him a ride to where he was going his first night there, and had rich conversations for the short time we were all together). I had my motley collection of contact-mics and sampling objects and looping pedals and probably what could be called a portable John Cage concert, which I used to improvise alongside Achim as he did the same over enormous loudspeakers placed in the ceiling of the large public space in this gallery (yes, I recorded). Anyway, someone else coming in to collaborate set up next to me on the balcony overlooking the space, revealing a portable Doepfer A-100 suitcase model.\nThat‚Äôs when it was over. That‚Äôs the exact moment when a lot of things clicked, but apropos to our topic it was definitely the first time I felt the urging pang of modular desire, and barely realized it.\nFast forward ten years; as of 2012 I am the proud owner of a new disease known casually as idiomatic modularsynthacropy, or the addiction to building complex systems realized by modular synths. I think it‚Äôs genetic, because this is an occupation my wife lovingly calls ‚ÄúThe Rocket‚Äù due to my studio resembling a half-built starship cockpit (or at least the bar in one), and my brother being an actual rocket scientist.\nIt first manifested itself after Chicago ‚Äúevent‚Äù in the form of electronic tinkering and eventually the building of my own simple devices, made specifically to be used alongside other analog/acoustic instruments of improvisation. As it happened certain events also related to my unlucky job streak in the Internet business ended up affording me a barebones entry-level one 3U rack half-full beginner outfit: 8 ‚Äòeurorack‚Äô style modules, the format Doepfer popularized, and in fact some are the very same kind I had first seen in that suitcase ten years ago.\nMuffwigglers is the forum¬†for this disease, and there‚Äôs even a forthcoming¬†documentary. A lot of the musicians I admire the most are modular users, and I‚Äôm happy and fortunate to join their ranks along with a pretty decent wealth of electronic building knowledge under my belt in addition to the musicality. So¬†I shared some of my accumulated knowledge recently on that forum, and wanted to post it here and add a bit of history.\n¬† Everything listed here except for the first book were published after I started into the DIY world of audio, and after spending literally DAYS of searching and reading electronics tutorials and articles online, they have become my ‚Äògo-to‚Äô stack for reference and inspiration.\n1. If you aren‚Äôt familiar with¬†Forrest Mims, get familiar with him. I just picked up Vol I. of his ‚ÄúEngineer‚Äôs Mini Notebook‚Äù series, which is titled:¬†Timer, Op Amp \u0026amp; Optoelectronic Circuits \u0026amp; Projects. It should have been titled:¬†The Building Blocks of Analog Modular Synthesis, and I wish I had discovered it five years ago when I first started into building this stuff, cause it is indispensable. All the ‚Äúhow do i build a 555 timer?‚Äù and ‚Äúhow do i correctly power an opamp?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat frequencies do i get if i change these resistors?‚Äù questions that you search for hours on the Internet? It‚Äôs all in here ‚Äì there‚Äôs even a chapter on photocouplers ‚Äì aka ‚Äòvaractors‚Äô ‚Äì which are used a lot for CV audio systems.\nAnother specific project-oriented book but much more glossy and full of awesome examples and a DVD (which I haven‚Äôt gotten around to watching yet, shame on me) is¬†Handmade Electronic Music¬†by¬†Nicolas Collins. This one is specific to DIY audio hacking and electronic building, covering everything from building oscillators (different chips than the Mims books!) to circuit bending and experimental electronics.  3.¬†Make¬†has started releasing awesome print publications (I have two of the Maker‚Äôs Notebooks and love them). The one I‚Äôve found the most applicable and helpful to audio DIY is by¬†Charles Platt¬†and is one of the first:¬†Make: Electronics. Simple, easy to understand tutorials on the foundations of‚Ä¶ well, making stuff. With Electronics.\nFinally the most general of all of them but something that is a great learning resource for a wide range of electronic applications, by¬†Michael Jay Geier,¬†How to Diagnose and Fix Everything Electronic. The title doesn‚Äôt lie. Every chapter is basically a Cliff‚Äôs Notes on that particular subject or piece of equipment, summarizing how it works, what might go wrong with it or often does, and how to troubleshoot and fix it. It also includes quick introductions to fundamentals of physics and other things related to electronic parts and machines‚Ä¶ and most importantly to us, a wonderful introduction to oscilloscopes and how to both choose and use them.  All these books together will probably cost you as much as a good VCO module!¬†But they are worth it, I highly recommend any of these to the DIY audio muffer.\n ",

    "body": "Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of ‚Äúyear‚Äôs review‚Äù of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. Those 24 hours of music are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a ‚Äúbest of,‚Äù but it is some of the best music I‚Äôve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a ‚Äúcompendium‚Äù? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\nAnd yeah, there‚Äôs some strange shit indeed. Although I don‚Äôt cover any ‚Äúpop‚Äù here, there‚Äôs still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something attractive on this list. Click on the album title to find where you can get the release; you‚Äôll find an amazing amount of these are on bandcamp and can be streamed for free. These also aren‚Äôt in any particular order, they all stand alone on their own and can‚Äôt really be compared to each other as a ‚Äútop-#‚Äù list. So without further a‚Äôdo‚Ä¶\n¬†Andy Stott\nPassed Me By / We Stay Together\nModern Love\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don‚Äôt expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n¬†Kangding Ray\nOR\nRaster-Noton\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums of strategically placed pitch-shifted static and buzzing and genuinely enjoy it. These tracks, however, have a personality that stands out among all the other click-pop-n-wrinkle hardcore glitch. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n¬†**Aril Brikha\n** _Palma / Forever Frost\n_ Art of Vengeance\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs ‚Äì on Brikha‚Äôs new label, very worth following ‚Äì provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4√ó4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n¬†Daniel Menche\nFeral\nSub Rosa\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I‚Äôd certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, so definitely looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\n¬†**The Black Dog\n** Liber Dogma\nLiber¬†Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\nLiber¬†Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\nLiber¬†Nox¬†(Book 3 Ov 3)\nDust Science\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It‚Äôs like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here‚Äôs a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you‚Äôre one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12‚Ä≥es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient Music for Real Airports, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. Dogma, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I‚Äôve heard from that era doesn‚Äôt touch the production values of what they‚Äôre doing now.\n¬†**Shpongle\n** _The God Particle\n_ Twisted\nI can‚Äôt deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I‚Äôm all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it‚Äôs perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlight of the Luminous Insects‚Äù). I guess there‚Äôs a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can‚Äôt be a bad thing.\n¬†**Phoenecia\n** _Demissions\n_ Schematic\nIt‚Äôs really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you‚Äôll often think ‚Äúman this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,‚Äù complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It‚Äôs not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n¬†Margaret Dygas\nMargaret Dygas\nPerlon\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones‚Ä¶ sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you‚Äôre sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn‚Äôt even realize had happened.\n¬†Amon Tobin\nISAM (Control Over Nature)\nNinja Tune\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at Buzz). I share some heritage with the album too, mastered as it is by my buddy Shawn (aka Twerk) over at AudibleOddities.\n¬†Logreybeam\n_Perhaps\n_ Les Enregistrements Variables\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the solemn hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I fondly call this melancholy collection ‚Äòshoegaze klezmer‚Äô, if for nothing but the acoustic instrumentation. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n¬†Matthew Mercer\nPianissimo Possibile\nself-released\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you‚Äôre as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those‚Ä¶ here broken‚Ä¶ gLitsched‚Ä¶ expectations frustrated ‚Äì (just look at the title) ‚Äì an immensely enjoyable equal footing of structure and form with materials instead of turning into some kind of accompaniment‚Ä¶ driven and poignant, thickly colorful expositions.\n¬†DeepChord\nHash Bar Remnants, Part I¬†\u0026amp; Part II\nSoma\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno ‚Äì in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n¬†**John Tejada\n** _Parabolas\n_ Kompakt\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n¬†Aeroc\nR+B=?\nGhostly\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n¬†~‚ñ≤‚Ä†‚ñ≤~\n~‚ñ≤‚Ä†‚Ä†‚ñ≤~\nPhantasma Disques\n‚àÜAIMON\nAMEN / AMEN Remixes\nTundra Dub\nWhen you‚Äôre actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you‚Äôre thinking, ‚ÄúRUN‚Äôs house!‚Äù). The alternatives are maybe not that better‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòOkkvlt‚Äô is probably what works best for me, but there‚Äôs also ‚ÄòZombie Rave‚Äô or the more musicological but equally confusing term ‚Äòdrag‚Äô‚Ä¶ not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I‚Äôve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n¬†",

    "body": "The call burst across as I was sitting in the datacenter.\n‚ÄúLIHSTEN MAHN!‚Äù came the south London accent, and I could barely discern the tones of a minimal dubby Dirk Diggler broken beat track that I used to play all the time back on the turntables we had set up at the office‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS TAHT ‚ÄòUN TRAC OO PLAHAY.‚Äù\nWhen I walked into this place somewhere in SoHo, there were beams of light being reflected from everywhere around me. In every conceivable surface was plastered thousands of square mirrors, and opposite the back of the bar to the immediate left was the woman herself, Miss Dinky, in the midst of another one of my favorite deep house tracks I was currently dropping back home, very likely Hakan Lidbo or something of that sort.\nNaturally this wasn‚Äôt even the first time I had heard of her. In fact, living in Chicago at the time I only knew her from the select vinyl releases I picked up downstairs at Reckless Records. Working occasionally in New York meant I could be close to that part of the dance music scene at the same time, so it was an exciting event to actually run into Dinky at a bar-cum-club no larger than your average corner deli.\nRecently I‚Äôve been listening to the beats on Anemik and they remind me of that night, grabbing the cab downtown to go where I knew one of my weirdly found idols of techno was spinning that very night in a tiny location nobody else knew about. Actually, it‚Äôs a strange coincidence this same friend of mine and I happened upon Deep Dish at a similarly tiny club in Chicago‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs for another blog and another glass of chartreuse.\n",

    "body": "I happen to be a voracious reader. I would probably write more if I didn‚Äôt read so much. One thing I‚Äôve noticed is the tendency to obsess on a single writer‚Äôs work: someone or something will turn me on to a specific author, I‚Äôll read one of his or her works, and immediately want to read everything they‚Äôve ever done. On occasion I accomplish this, but sometimes the task is simply too great.\nCurrently I‚Äôm on an Arthur C. Clarke (CBE) trip, embarking with¬†Childhood‚Äôs End after recently finishing Rendezvous with Rama. To be honest these purchases were inspired by Clarke‚Äôs death in March of 2008, when I remembered how he changed my life while a freshman in high school.\nIt‚Äôs pretty interesting how we remember things, especially points in time that present themselves as an immediate recollection, almost painting-like in their clarity. When I first was assigned the task of reading the novel 2001 as a freshman in the remote western mountains of North Carolina, there was some sort of stencil work done on my brain. I recall a very specific day in that classroom, noticing the green of a fresh blackboard, where I was so incredibly thrilled with this fantastic view into the Universe, that I immediately picked up 2010 and kept reading.¬†Probably it was two or three years before I saw the accompanying films.\nThen there was William Gibson. I read Neuromancer and was completely hooked: I went through a barrage of Gibson novels right in a row, staying up late into the night when I should have been practicing, but instead being sucked into fantasies of Black Ice and the fast paced action of transient networks and cyberpunk, reality TV and a California civil war, popular meme-based advertising and terrorist plots ‚Äì the language and ideas all resonate with me strongly.\nBut perhaps this was all an extension of my admitted affairs with the art and writings of¬†William S. Burroughs and Paul Bowles (his Wikipedia entry curiously devoid of photographs); authors whose catalog I have yet to extinguish but to whose prose I am drawn. Bowles holds a special place with me because I really got into his compositions for voice, singing many of them in recitals. My next multi-book adventure will be The Red Night Trilogy, parts of which I‚Äôve read and even adapted to music.\nI‚Äôm not sure what it is, but perhaps others have the same sort of drive I do, to explore authors and artists to whatever extent necessary. This leads me to wonder whether these types of minds will always exist, regardless of what we think ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô is doing to our ability to appreciate non-technical forms of expression. Just because our mediums change doesn‚Äôt mean the human spirit has lost the ability to create beauty.\n",

    "body": "So much music. Nowhere to begin. Everywhere is a beginning, none end.\nEver felt overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of works out there? I do all the time, daily in fact. I tend to find new listening by discovery through association, especially through publishers and artists that cross stylistic boundaries. Sometimes I feel like I have a certain knack to picking things out, almost to the extent it feels random, but in context it really never is.\nSound sticks with me like nothing else. Some have the ability to remember words by rote and spit back movie quotes from things I haven‚Äôt seen in 20 years, others can pick out anyone they‚Äôve met before in a crowd. I never forget a sound, you could say I have phonographic memory.\nIt‚Äôs almost like having perfect pitch, but I can never relate anything absolutely to a specific frequency. Those square pointy hat people in tall robes would call it having ‚Äòrelative pitch‚Äô, but I think it‚Äôs more like aural memory. Sonic textures, bits of audio, melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, vocal personalities, wind players‚Äô tone‚Ä¶ I have a hard time not making an association when I hear things, it‚Äôs like having a cochlear imprint.\nSo I am constantly searching for new things, seeking out what‚Äôs new to my ears, both when performing and listening. The amount of people out there doing the same thing astounds me‚Ä¶ I could listen for weeks and weeks, day in and day out, and not find anything interesting until after several months at it.\nAnd we are all being pressured to do it so fast, the releases come at us with unrelenting speed.\n",

    "body": "It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve sincerely blogged, as I‚Äôve been somewhat obscured by computing lately. You‚Äôd think with all these computers around me, I‚Äôd be blogging all the time; but what I really want is less of them around me so that it feels like something more special than just another thing I do on the computer.\nFor example, this weekend was my birthday weekend (born in 1971, for those counting), and it felt very good going on ‚Äúcomputer silence‚Äù for two days after the Friday night party. In fact, I didn‚Äôt do much of anything except plan my set for next Saturday, play Super Mario Bros Wii, and work through the pileup of recorded Showtime serials with my wife.\nA good deal of people I know that make music on computers do so as a second life to their work day on them. Multitasking on computing problems at the same time as applying yourself creatively ‚Äì and otherwise using software, interfacing with recording gear, attached hard drives, sound drivers, etc‚Ä¶ all while you‚Äôre also concentrating on finishing that perl script for your job (if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be in an environment where your work computer can double as a creative tool), and of course keeping up with ‚Äúthe scene‚Äù in blog format or forums or twitter and social networks, not to mention keeping up with what feels like an exponentially growing volume of album releases ‚Äì is not a very sustainable way to work.\nSwitching between brain processes like this often makes me feel fractured, like I am not quite in touch with the things that I identify with creating art. The myriad problems of computer technology are an infinitely complex layer of interaction which I can frankly do without. The irony of this is that before I went into a highly disciplined performance school, I had a ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù undergrad major in music, focusing on Composition and Music Technology (a type of degree that‚Äôs now been heavily formalized in many universities, and is no longer rare at all). From that point forward, technology became a very important part of my musical description.\nAt some point, however, technology took over. It‚Äôs taken me many years to see in retrospect that what I was doing isn‚Äôt quite what I loved to do as a performer and an artist, and splitting my attention between things wasn‚Äôt helping my attempts at doing great things. As an extension of that, I believe my will to do original things was diminished by the layer of complexity and confusion brought on by an intervening computer operating system. Pretty soon, the issues I faced in my day-job became the same issues I faced in music making on the computer, and it wasn‚Äôt long that I couldn‚Äôt handle that union of cognitive space. I‚Äôve now found myself not wanting to open a computer at all after I get home from work.\nThis may have a lot to do with circumstantial things: my day-job work environment isn‚Äôt great (bright fluorescent lamps, no privacy, high stress when on-call, poor management, general chaos), and I‚Äôve had to sideline my musical activities in lieu of getting back up to speed on things I need for this job. When I get home, I don‚Äôt want to do much except unravel from the day, my motivation to create is low ‚Äì not necessarily because I don‚Äôt want to make music, but because the enormous task of what to do with it after I‚Äôm done isn‚Äôt something I feel like dealing with any longer.\nSo I‚Äôm looking forward to this week in particular: in the coming days I‚Äôll continue preparation and practicing for my set on 12/12, where I can just play music and not worry about computers in the process. I have some hurdles to overcome ‚Äì fixing/patching the new modular so that at least *some* of it works, paring down the complexity of my instruments ‚Äì so I will be forced to focus on music in the way I love: brainpower in the pursuit of creativity.\n",

    "body": "Audiobulb has released a free sampler of music from eight artists on the label, including a track off Supple (see post below), subtly arranged and expertly mixed by label owner David Newman. Others included are: Jimmy Behan, Biosphere, Ultre, NQ, Mark Harris, Hans van Eck and He Can Jog. I‚Äôm honored to be among the talent in that lineup, and the music is just awesome.\nAlso recently, Xynthetic produced their Second Statement, a stunning cross-section of the artist roster that displays the wide variety to be had on the netlabel. My track ‚ÄúHerbsttag‚Äù is a taste of some dub to come, so keep yer eyes peeled for more Craque on Xynthetic. üôÇ\nA new .microsound project has come around again, this time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of William Burroughs‚Äôs novel Naked Lunch [player will auto-start].\nUncle Bill was a huge influence on the way I thought about putting things together to arrive at previously impossible conclusions, plus I was drawn to his relationship with my favorite beat, Paul Bowles. In fact, I wrote a piece for Comma called Sevenroughs just after he passed to the next level. This time around I still used the number 7, but applied it to divisions of the time limit, 3 minutes. I also kept to the fractured use of text (Sevenroughs uses The Western Lands), and the title is the first two words of the score: Making Pink [6.4MB 320mbps mp3].\n\nTo prepare a score, I started on page 1, with the last printed entity on the first line, page 2 the last entity on the second, and so on. Punctuation was taken alone, words only half-hypenated, and once I had reached the bottom of the page, I‚Äôd start back up on the first line. There were several happenings of the [ .‚Äù ] combination, so those became major delimiters of form. The outcome [fixed-font best for viewing] is a full cut-up of Naked Lunch, upon whose text I layered improvised sounds, with additional form and structure derived from the placement of the randomly intruding punctuation.\nIn addition to these recent projects, I‚Äôve posted an archival recording of a live gallery show at Feti√ßo in Chicago, 2001. It‚Äôs in three parts, and is the most recent entry on CraqueCast, also subscribable and previewable in iTunes.\nA special treat for blog readers: my collection of ringtones, RINGTONALITY! Great name huh? Well, these are loopy sort of poppy sometimes glitchy electronica beat things that I‚Äôve made along the way, and are pretty loud with all sorts of variety. There are two versions available for download: the ‚Äúm4r iPhone‚Äù version [6MB zip], and the FLAC version [42MB zip] for those who want to convert and use on another platform, or just want them otherwise. Feel free to pass them around.\n‚Äì\nDespite being laid off from my job in May, I‚Äôve been trying to stay positive and keep active doing things: gardening, reviewing stuff for job interviewing like perl and networking and other unix/linux peculiarities, job searching of course, but also a good bit of music making. Other than some possible releases of newly improvised excursions, I‚Äôve been attempting to make contact with some local galleries (Orange County, CA) for presenting experimental sound work and/or events. So as you can see, creativity continues to attempt its way out of my subconscious, and I continue to be hopeful that the perfect job is right around the corner.\n",

    "body": "Presenting: an electro-acoustic album of experimental sound sources and improvisations punctuated by iterative percussion, i.e. glitchy ambient slightly funky dance music. üòâ\nSupple is the way I‚Äôve seen things come together over several years after moving to California, and owes some to dance forms that made this area of the country so important to electronic music development and culture. They are presented in a sort of story-form (I‚Äôll blame my operatic tendencies for that), where endings and beginnings aren‚Äôt so easily discerned, and overall structure blends them in a sort of high-contrast, watercolor way‚Ä¶ which I think is matched in visual form by gl0tch (check out the release page to see different versions of the cover art morphing), giving it all this primordial evolutionary cybernetic aspect that I love, as if everything is a petri dish of mechanically chaotic musical questions.\nThe tunes span from when I first moved here in 2002 up until 2008; ‚ÄúNavfrakure‚Äù was laid down as a¬†one-night brush stroke back on a chilly October night, and grew into something quite deeper. Although ‚ÄúLusid Crystalin‚Äù is the oldest, written within a month of my relocation from Chicago, ‚ÄúTopless‚Äù contains samples culled from a recording session with the trio Comma ‚Äì recorded in Brooklyn way back in I think 1999.\nMany of these tracks contain and/or are built with free improvisations I do on my homemade instruments and improvisation rig (read my blog further for some descriptions and pics). It‚Äôs an on-going process, building a morphing performance engine, a lot of which was originally from and inspired by my work with Comma, Gray Code, and the free improv scene in general.\nObjects and constructions are sampled, voices rendered, and recently my simple DIY analog synths have given an entirely new dimension, all combined together with an array of acoustic instruments (mostly guitar, cello, prepared piano and african hand percussion), and processed with hardware looping and delay devices. In some cases the improv remains relatively intact, in others it is pieced out and chopped as if‚Ä¶ Burroughsian perversions, perhaps? Joycean slips of the tongue, a composting of ideas and pursuasions that melt together as if merging stained‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúSextant‚Äù is a poem I wrote around 2004:\n Blue chrome carriage\nMouse brown hair\nDark shadowed eyes\nCold mean stare\nWhite-armed glove driver\nSunshine in your car\nIf the signal never signaled\nWould you have gone that far?\n The Audiobulb release page contains links to eMusic, iTunes, Thrill Jockey and boomkat sites for purchasing the album. There‚Äôs also an interview with me including other details about the album and music making and creativity and things like that, with clips from some of the tracks I‚Äôve mentioned here.\nLend Me Your Ears has a feature on Supple, as well as an interview that has different questions from the Audiobulb one, very little repeat info! super bonus! There‚Äôs also a free download of track 2, ‚ÄúNavfrakure.‚Äù Double Super Bonus!\n",

    "body": "Here‚Äôs something I thought I‚Äôd never see myself do in my own lifetime: build a synthesizer from scratch.\nActually it‚Äôs a simple design: 2 555 timers in astable configuration producing square-waves. This means it‚Äôs a burst of sound every interval, pretty annoying and not very useful except for maybe starting earthquakes. So to give it a little flavor, I put a low-pass, 2-pole filter on the output of each oscillator, using a traditional operational amplifier.\n\nA bit over a year ago it started out as a learning experience for me, I had never gotten into building things with analog circuitry ‚Äì although I dated a chick in college who was an EE, so I was vaguely familiar with a breadboard. As a result, my design is √ºber simple, and in reality was the design I could ‚Äúget to work‚Äù from the opamp (a weird beast in itself, I will be tackling it again soon enough).\nAfter a lot of experimentation and research on the web (these days a DIY‚Äôers first reference), I came up with a 2-rail power design that provided 9V for the oscillators and 4.5V for the bipolar opamp (just left of the battery in the schematic). Moving left, the 741 opamp (NTE941) provides a low-pass, 2-pole filter to the signal from the 555 timer (NTE955).\nThe cutoff frequency of the filter is controlled with a potentiometer, as is the pitch of the oscillator. You can also see my modification in the lower left for a ‚Äúrange‚Äù switch, which wasn‚Äôt on the breadboard prototype, but made it onto my final PCB because I think it adds a lot more interest and possibilities.\nThis was an intense project, no doubt. I got some training on soldering little kits that got made into sculpture, and I am a proud builder and owner of a bleep labs thingamakit, and have recently built the wave sheild for my new arduino board (which I haven‚Äôt quite gotten to work yet, so I hope it‚Äôs my programming skills and not my soldering skills).\nAs much as I tried to plan out wire distribution inside the chassis where the pots and switches would not interfere too much with the PCB, sure enough I drilled the holes sort of on the wrong end of the enclosure, so the edges don‚Äôt match unless I flipped it, and of course I only discover this after everything is screwed into the front. So, fixing it meant pulling all the knobs and switches back out, and removing the PCB from its mount on the inside and flipping it 180 degrees, then re-attaching everything.\nIn the end it really didn‚Äôt make that much of a difference and the whole thing came together fairly perfectly anyway. What I haven‚Äôt really done is add any decoration or labels, which I do want to do‚Ä¶ inspiration will strike when I least expect it, perhaps it will not only get illustration but also a name, and it will evolve!\n",

    "body": "I like to make myself feel as if I‚Äôm somehow close to the elusive community of electronic music. My problem, however, is that I am way too interested in multiple facets of music releases to pay attention in any style for very long. I seek out what really turns my ear, the gems of sound that are unique statements of purpose or individuality. Since I desire great pieces of listening, I spend time searching for it, which means I listen to a lot of not so great things too, and that goes double for netlabels. Needless to say I associate my music activities in a very close circle, I do very fringe stuff, really of a limited appeal on the grand scheme of things. My listening is only very more or less fringey than that, but I thought, well hell why not, I listen to all this music I may as well review it (however briefly) and share my twisted sense of what‚Äôs good music to the dozen people who bother to look at my blog (and if you do, i thank you for at least being interested). And yes you guessed it, listening to all 24 albums shown here will take you almost exactly 24 hours. So enjoy!\nAutistici : Volume Objects : 12K\nSubtle explorations of sound relationships and rhythm, blending elements of recognizable instruments and easy going synth gestures with elegantly placed electro-acoustic underpinning. I imagine a conductor with the most supreme control of his sonic elements, swirling around in a glaze.\nVarious : Favorite Places : Audiobulb\nA wonderful concept! Recordings and compositions from favorite places of the included artists, a very personal record, wide in breadth. Equal parts phonography and arranged constructions, in some cases I feel like I become part of that place. Eerie and magical.\nEllen Allien : Sool : BPitch Control\nCount this one as a surprise indeed. I‚Äôm used to a heavier hand when it comes to bpitch and this gal, so a well-crafted minimal techno album with some actual musical interest was the last thing I expected. The tunes are understated but driven in a way that especially matches the style, engaging but never harsh.\nHe Can Jog : Middlemarch : Audiobulb\nThere is a finesse with which HCJ can blend noise and consonance that‚Äôs infectious and maybe just a little frightening. He shares the same ranks with other electro-acoustic artists here that like a tasty blend of percussion with their textures, and I think he does it quite excellently with a sparing amount of sugar on top.\nIlkae : Light Industry : Eerik Inpuj Sound\nJust one person now, Ilkae has released one heck of an outing that mixes pure abstract expressionism with a smattering of melodies and structures that stick in my ear until I‚Äôm humming it when I wake up in the morning. LSK and Magnesium are both choice cuts.\nProswell : Cyclothymia : Eerik Inpuj Sound\nOver 65 tracks between 0 and 6 minutes. Inspired miniatures, fully rounded songs, brief brightly colored sketchings; some of the best work he‚Äôs done to date. A lot of the songs appeared in a podcast over the course of the year, but it is great to have a full collection of them under one cover. Randomized listening highly recommended.\nVarious : Format : F√§llt\nAlong the same lines of the miniatures Proswell and Ilkae (and myself, inspired by thus) have done, one of my favorite pieces of this comp is Tonne‚Äôs ‚ÄúPaper/Pixels‚Äù: a corrugated 71 tracks at only 7 seconds or less apiece, from tiny little beats looped once to bursts of noise or nearly silence. Taylor Deupree and FourColor also stand out on this one, wonderful collection!\nTape : Luminarium : H√§pna\nPolished construction and structure, with a perfect balance of acoustic and electric. These guys know how to make an ensemble be an ensemble and not just a band trying to add computers. The compositional acumen stands on its own in a collection of poignant, soft melodies and instrumentation that I haven‚Äôt quite heard before in this context. Looking forward to more from this gang.\nVarious : Magnetism, That Electricity‚Ä¶ : HighPoint LowLife\nAll the HPLL artists shine on this comp, but I especially like the dark analog synth contributions of Fink Industries (check out the remixes of his tracks too) and the contrasting bubbly lift of The Marcia Blaine School for Girls. There is such a wide range of styles on here that it‚Äôs difficult to describe, but it‚Äôs fantastic listening with a tropical forest of influences and approaches.\nAnders Ilar : Sworn : Level\nMoving to the 4√ó4 side of things, a flawlessly constructed set of tracks. Haunting would be a good word to describe the melodies and dub feel, but really it‚Äôs just good smooth techno with a nice groove and peppered funky.\nVarious : Terminal : Narita\nThis does have an Ilar track on it that could have easily been on Sworn, but it features so many other great techno folks that it deserves a place on my list for sure. Not to mention it‚Äôs supposedly the very last release from the depths of Merck/Narita. I like working in the garden with this one thumping out to me‚Ä¶ Senior Frio, Blamstrain, Arctic Hospital, Brothomstates, Yard, Adam Johnson‚Ä¶ grow plants grow!\nByetone : Death of a Typographer : Raster-Noton\nI was pleasantly surprised when hearing this mechanical beast roar in my studio. Pure waveforms have become the subject of extreme grooves and almost downright hooky harmonic form. It‚Äôs good to hear these guys move on from their surgical masturbation to something more substantial. I‚Äôm all for delicate glass soundscapes but you can only have so many before the personality is literally worn thin.\n√ò : Oleva : S√§hk√∂\nThere are times when blocks of sound and imagined landscapes go hand in hand. Just wonderfully alien and funky, stuff that makes your torso vibrate. Contains probably my favorite Pink Floyd cover ever; ‚Äúset the controls for the heart of the sun‚Äù is perfect for brooding, dark-sparked audio.\nVarious : Round Black Ghosts : ~scape\nI have to be honest, the output of this label has been questionable for the past few years, so it‚Äôs good to hear this collection of experimentally tinged and dub-inspired dance grooves. Pole stands out of course, but 2562‚Äôs ‚ÄúChannel Two‚Äù is probably my favorite.\nJuxta Phona \u0026amp; OffTheSky : !Escape Kit! : Somnia\nUnquestionably the best new thing to come out of Evan Bluetech‚Äôs new label. There is a hefty amount of experimentalism balanced out by beats, supported by (of course) a dub atmosphere, but further punctuated by a free jazz influence. Right up my alley, the vibraphone work is especially sublime. Somnia has turned out not to be a hyper-ambient thing like I feared, I‚Äôm encouraged by the diversity of their CD‚Äôs so far, and I love the beautiful packaging. Some of the only CDs I still buy, in fact.\nBrassica : Microvictories : Tartaruga\nAnother CD I had to buy because of the packaging, Calika recommended this album, calling it the best thing he had heard this year. As you can see I had a hard enough time narrowing things down to 24, so naming something numero uno isn‚Äôt really my bag. However, I absolutely love the approach in this music. The same sort of collage-inspired acousmatic blending but with his own unique voice in a way that draws you into what‚Äôs happening, and before you know it the album is over. And you get an oragami turtle with it! How awesome is that?\nD‚Äôincise : Les Restes du Festin : Test Tube\nThis music reminds me the most of music school, I‚Äôm not sure why. I think there is a connection with composers I studied that made a subliminal crossing to the work of d‚Äôincise, but it could be the natural fluidity of the sound that works the most like a classical string quartet. I enjoy the fact that he uses less beats but arrives at the same atmosphere as earlier albums, carrying the listener along in what seems to be a storyline that never quite reveals itself.****\nFennesz : Black Sea : Touch\nFinally a Fennesz I can listen to all the way through without thinking it was on repeat the whole time. There is a lot more diversity in this record than any other, showing a real willingness to develop beyond the distorted-guitar-drone rut. I‚Äôve heard other die-hard Fennesz fans poo-poo this album, so it‚Äôs interesting I think it‚Äôs more mature than others. It‚Äôs similar to how I think Murcof has grown, I‚Äôm looking forward to what he‚Äôs doing this year as well.\nPortishead : Third : Universal Island\nUniquely spectacular in their own way. It thrills me to no end that they employed their own studio recordings for this instead of the sample-based thing. Not that Dummy isn‚Äôt the best triphop album ever, but they‚Äôve shown here that the band is really a group with something musical to say, not just push out badass basslines. Beth Gibbons has the most sultry voice ever, I cannot get enough of her inflection.\nAutechre : Quaristice : Warp\nSay what you will, the ‚Äúbonus‚Äù CD for this album is so much better than the ‚Äúoriginal version‚Äù of the tracks. I think it‚Äôs an amazing escape into surreal dancescapes and fractured electro, it‚Äôs very mature and non-egotistic Booth‚Äôn‚ÄôBrown just having fun and making some cool ass tunes. The reason people hate these guys for doing things like this is because they won‚Äôt drop their expectations and just listen to the sound, and want it all to be like 1997 again.\nFlying Lotus : Los Angeles : Warp\nWhat I had always wished Prefuse73 was. And now I no longer have to! Artists who pull out just the right elements of hip hop that I like and pull it threadbare through an electronics sieve are A-OK in my book. It also helps this is not an hour of the same approach to beatcutting and voice splicing over and over again. I concede people are into that. I‚Äôm not.\nDeadbeat : Roots and Wire : Wagon Repair\nIf you couldn‚Äôt tell there is a definitely swing towards the reggae side of things in my library. Swelling basslines and rim snaps, echoes filtering every which way, the sort of limping I love most. What starts off as a minimalistic break-beaty sort of dancehall album assuredly melts into easy rolling dubhouse. I think it‚Äôs the most well put together Deadbeat of any.\nLetna : Tisza Meets Dunav : Zymogen\nAh some of the most beautiful drones of the year. Very popular this style, it‚Äôs only really successful when done with detail and depth. This album imagines me drifting between layers of impossibly smokey silk.\nJimmy Behan : In the Sudden Distance : Zymogen\nA sort of minimal chamberwork, with an unevenness and simplicity that mingles the sound as if it belonged there the whole time. Definitely ambient, but more personal than a pure drone album, with smaller spaces and more intricacy.\nSome others worth mentioning:\nImplex Grace : Through Luminescent Passages (I \u0026amp; II)\nHRSTA : Ghosts Will Come Kiss Our Eyes\nHol Baumann : Human\nFly Pan Am : Ceux Qui Inventent N‚ÄôOnt Jamis Vecu\nEvan Marc + Steve Hillage : Dreamtime Submersible\nElectricwest : Divine de Vice\nAlva Noto : UNITXT\nWilder Gonzales Agreda : Se Tu Propio Totem\nTrivium : Shogun\nTanox : Astronomia de Balcon\nSecret Chiefs 3 : Xaphan: Book of Angels Vol. 9\nop.cit. : Under the Sweel\nnaw : vague terrain 10: digital dub\nMotionfield : Optical Flow\nModel 500 : Starlight remixes\nLone : Lemurian\nVarious : Dame Citrus\n",

Children and adolescents play a nearly incomprehnsible nuclear strategy game with tennis equipment against a real or holographic (?) backdrop of sabotaged ATHSCME 1900 atmospheric displacement towers exploding and toppling during the New New England Chemical Emergency of Y.W. CELLULOID (UNRELEASED)\n I took 45 minutes as my guiding point and imagined the film was a tableau, a ‚Äúmoving still life‚Äù of sorts. It‚Äôs a 45 minute long game, a slow motion still life of a disaster reflected in the childsplay of fooling around with physics.\nWe see a setting that never changes, of innocent children (we assume the same as in the pictures referenced by the title) against a backdrop that is ever changing, sharing an appetite for control. They become the embodiment of the Famous Dictators, playing games, like children, with adult toys of power and war.\nA chemical emergency could imply this is related to nuclear power or physics. Are the children playing a game that caused the emergency? Are they blissfully unaware? Or are they working to solve the problem by a series of complex nuclear games? It‚Äôs unclear if we will ever know.\nThe soundtrack is not a reflection of the action seen onscreen, but rather the literal voice of each proper name. As their structures compost, weaving as they play the game, new forms are illuminated.\nThese nine names were used to drive various parameters specific to each person‚Äôs voice, guiding things like frequency, filters, delay effects and envelope (in each case, the longest, most familiar version of the English proper name was used):\n Adolf Hitler Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini Mao Zedong Ho Chi Minh Francisco Franco Bahamonde Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz Saddam Hussein Tojo Hideki  The analysis of the text file containing the names was done with perl, which wrote out various ChucK files. The entire piece is one large ChucK session recorded to a file, then normalized.\nWhen I started the piece was a lot less ‚Äúbright‚Äù than it ultimately became, but in a strange way I feel like it took on its own character, and mourns both the tragedy of these dictators and the loss of DFW.\nThe player on the project page is a great way to listen to the soundtracks everyone has done, and allows for direct downloads of the works.\n",

    "description": "",
    "body": "I‚Äôm very happy to announce the release of a project I did this summer called Tekuchesti (a transliteration of —Ç–µ–∫—É—á–µ—Å—Ç–∏, which is a Russian word meaning ‚Äúfluidity‚Äù), a piece in shuffle time for listeners and improvisers.\nDownload the entire work, and remember to listen on shuffle. Weird request you say? Read the liner notes below for more detail‚Ä¶\nPlease also visit the release page at Constanta and check out the other artists on this new boutique netlabel, which features some unique approaches to the microsound/glitch/experimental/drone genres; beauty through subtlety and simplicity. I personally enjoy op.cit.‚Äôs and To4ka.Dna‚Äôs most recent releases.\nHere is my description and instructions for performance (these notes are also available in Russian through Constanta):\n In tectonics, slices of the earth can be reduced bit by bit to their constituents, all in motion consistent with the plate. Below these fractured mantle pieces is a thick world of geology: elemental chemical reactions, intense temperature changes, varying strata of materials. There may be violent upheaval or capitulation of forces, or just still and silent veins of metal. If we could travel as a massless beings through the earth to the antipodal, each layer of Hell opens not a Dantean dream, but a surreal tour of random pockets describing the origin of the solar system.\nTekuchesti represents ‚Äúfluidity‚Äù in physics, describing instability or fluid states. The piece consists of constructions mostly taken from free electro-acoustic improvisations, first recorded to create large elemental plates of experience, and secondly edited and combined into subdivisions of space. There were no structural or material limitations placed on the recording or editing of the improvisations, they simply happened.\nJust as there are myriad structures and surprise events, there are the lack of these events, represented by the isochrons; dating scatterplots of history, constructions made from the lack of material to represent that which has passed on. The sonic architecture of each isochron in this piece is taken from relationships found in the five Platonic (or ‚Äúperfect‚Äù) solids, found everywhere in nature, above and below the crust.\nThis piece is meant to be played in random order, where the slices intermingle anew each time to create an emergent form. Playing it in order will reveal some of the underlying structure, and is a perfectly acceptable way of listening ‚Äì the shapes of the plates become much more clear, but it is an altogether different listening experience. Improvisers are encouraged to play along as well, but if done in a live context, it must be played on shuffle, as this will give the improvisers less expectation of what sounds will appear.\nThe work also ties in an immediate tectonic experience: I live only 10 miles from the epicenter of the 5.4 magnitude earthquake which hit the LA area on July 29, just shortly before the album was finalized. It also represents the ‚Äúsolid ground‚Äù ‚Äì both as shared vision and literal Earth ‚Äì between me and the constanta-label.ru headquarters in Perm, Russia.\n Constanta on the web: http://constanta-label.ru\nConstanta on myspace: http://www.myspace.com/constantalabel\n",

But the end result is that they sound simple and great.\nAt long last Tom has released the SoundHack Delay Trio, the description of the algorithms is fantastic, from the announcement:\n ‚ÄúAll of these are derived from the same basic delay algorithm: a hermite interpolated delay line with variable modulation, and a feedback loop with dc blocking and saturation. Pitch shifting is achieved with a dual head crossfading delay (ala Eltro Tempophon/Dennis Gabor/Pierre Schaeffer phonogene) and is decidedly low-Ô¨Å. The saturating feedback also allows them to be great drone and noise generators.‚Äù\n Awesome work!

    "date": "",
    "description": "",
    "body": "In response to the many sad emails and messages about Loungeometry, the evident is true: Kettle and the Keg has decided on their own to forgo lounge music to try and bring in more customer base. Loungeometry has been discontinued.\nAt a certain level, the finger can be pointed at the City of Fullerton. Incentives for business to open downtown, efforts to revitalize and bring consumers into the city, extensive renovation projects and residential development‚Ä¶ all these things have brought an enormous influx of people, and merchants are struggling to compete for their wallets in the only way they know how: bait them with popular culture.\nUltimately I think it‚Äôs just causing growing pains, and Fullerton can‚Äôt quite deal with it. The way to deal with the kind of crowd that they don‚Äôt want isn‚Äôt to limit the rights of the People (and it‚Äôs obvious that, after seeing nightly fist fights all over Fullerton parking lots, there is a distinct element of People that Fullerton wishes were diminished), but to diversify how the People can Experience Fullerton.\nPeople complain that the Fullerton PD is too much in evidence (regardless of the fact that their HQ is practically the same block as a majority of frequented Fullerton bars), but would they be if there was not so much to notice? There seems to be a desire by local business owners to grab the attention of city visitors in hopes of catching the most action from their pockets, not broaden their horizons or provide entertainment for a diverse population.\nI‚Äôve also noticed that, when it comes to drawing people in, places tend to copy one another. Supply and Demand, basic economics right? I have never taken a single business class in my life, but my experience has witnessed the need for Balance in the Supply and Demand factor, and lack of diversity causes stagnation. The popularity of Hip Hop and 80‚Äôs nostalgia is overwhelming to the point where bar owners are hiring those kinds of DJ‚Äôs exclusively.\nIt makes me think that music directors for these places are really more interested in doing as little work as possible promoting their place while going with ‚Äúthe sure bet‚Äù in music. These places continue to shift their allegiance to the dollar instead of the music. Picking up the popular item of the day shows how transient these bars are in their attitude; if they believe keeping up with the trend will give them ultimate longevity, then they aren‚Äôt thinking ahead nearly far enough.\nAre there merchants in this town that are truly interested in what music venues used to be about: presenting, supporting and glorifying great music from ANY genre? Do they have a choice, or do they even WANT the choice? To what extent are businesses responsible for our cultural upbringing? How can they claim to be when they go for what‚Äôs hugely popular in a vertical market instead of what can be widely popular over multiple markets? Maybe those are business questions I just don‚Äôt understand.\nPromoting yourself by yourself is difficult, even when you‚Äôre accustomed to it. I didn‚Äôt get a lot of promotional support from the people at the K\u0026amp;K, seemingly because a lot of them are in different social circles than I. Many times I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being met halfway by the venue: i delivered flyers and media to them which subsequently got lost or forgotten, there is very poor marketing (if you were a block away you wouldn‚Äôt know it was there, a lack of advertising in area publications)‚Ä¶ the loss of hookahs with no effort to replace them really hurt big, it was a huge draw for the kind of demographic that enjoys the music I play. After they were removed, every thursday we noticed at least one large group of people walk in and walk right back out because the hookahs were gone ‚Äì with no explanation. One Thursday the place was completely shut down by the control board because of unpaid or late bills. It seemed like when they hit a roadblock, they would roll over and pretend it just didn‚Äôt happen.\nThe worst part about being ‚Äòlet go‚Äô by the bar isn‚Äôt that I can‚Äôt play there any more, but that they brought in a partner to re-do the entire entertainment offering without bringing it up with me. I‚Äôve been there nearly two years, I am hands-down the most reliable and punctual DJ they‚Äôve ever had. I never let the show collapse because of any reasons outside of weather. I did my best to try and find appropriate acts to bring in, had many guests over the months, and a barrage of comments like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt hear this kind of music anywhere else in LA!‚Äù I had Ubiquity asking about listening parties and shows there, but now I can‚Äôt follow up to try and schedule it.\nI brought an entire studio worth of DJ equipment to the venue every week (because I feel it a duty to keep the Vinyl DJ alive, that also included three bags of records); my turntables were even stolen from there once, and I persisted. Along with a steady and healthy reggae following, Loungeometry nights ‚Äì and all the people supporting me ‚Äì helped build their reputation as a lounge you could visit and relax with unique entertainment, but it turns out that was a reputation they didn‚Äôt want to uphold.\nJust for the record, I found out about the ‚Äúnew‚Äù entertainment the day before I was supposed to present Loungeometry again. The ‚Äòpartner‚Äô apparently asked if I could play different music‚Ä¶ that a band goes on first, followed by some other act, and I would be the wrap-up filler DJ at the end (they don‚Äôt have DJ equipment, remember).\nBut that‚Äôs not the reason I DJ, I‚Äôm not in this just to have a DJ slot where I can be a rock star and get attention. I‚Äôm in this for the music, and the nights I put together are solely for celebrating the kind of music you cannot hear anywhere else, but that deserves every right to be heard because it‚Äôs great and wonderful stuff.\nI don‚Äôt mean for this to be a hurtful diatribe against the venue, the people, or the city; but they are things I feel need saying.\nSometime soon I‚Äôll compile a list of some of my favorite Loungeometry music, but in the mean time you can hear archived sets on the CraqueCast.\n",

About half the time they‚Äôll love what I‚Äôm playing and just want to know if I have something. Last night, a well-cleavaged young lass (do groups of friends always send the hottest chick they have at the table to request something from the DJ?) begins asking me questions about what I have to play. Not happy with my answers of ‚Äúno‚Äù, and ‚Äúnot really‚Äù and ‚Äúi don‚Äôt play pop music‚Äù, she goes on drunkenly about some REALLY GREAT CD they have in their car, but that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play it because I had ‚Äúthis‚Äù. In the most alluring way possible she leans over, cocks her head sideways, motions at the turntable playing tech-house and asks, ‚ÄúSo what do you call this anyway?‚Äù I respond, oh this is Dub Taylor. At first she just nods, and her blonde friend comes up. Ms. Booby Brunette says to her, ‚Äúoh he can‚Äôt play our CD because he only has this Dub Taylor‚Äù while pointing at the turntable. Incredulous, I interrupt‚Ä¶ ‚Äúno no no, this isn‚Äôt a dub taylor, this is a TURNTABLE, the MUSIC is dub taylor‚Äù To which they both kind of giggle and flit off.\nTags: dj, shows\n",

Viv is a vocal experimenter from the UK who I met through Pauline Oliveros and the Deep Listening group, and has done some interesting work with ‚Äòwalkabout‚Äô listening and binaural recording. Carol is a Chicago-area vocalist who has worked with many other free improvisors and electronic musicians, we met through the improv scene there and were excited to do some collaboration for the Nervous Center. Three improvs were performed without any rehearsal for a small but exuberant audience in the basement of the Nervous Center. The three of us actually never rehearsed at all, what you hear is the first time any of us had performed together (we did do some pre-show planning the night before to go over technical details). The music is a fascinating romp. Most of the first two parts features Viv and Carol on voice, and I contributed vocal stuff in the third. During all of the set I am controlling the mixer and effects sends, as well as doing live sampling and amplification of objects (rocks, hand percussion, toys, etc).

But nowadays I‚Äôm looking at changing around my live setup, and think I‚Äôd really like to add a ‚Äòsample bank‚Äô to the config so I can work with pre-made samples as well as live-sampled sounds. There‚Äôs a few interesting companies I‚Äôve found, one of course I‚Äôve looked at for several years for some kind of modular setup of my own: the Doepfer CTM series is along the lines of what I‚Äôve been wanting. And now they have a cool ‚ÄòMini‚Äô enclosure to bring down the cost, cool huh? A similar device, specific to MIDI button control is being produced by Monome, though they have a limited product line with not so comparable prices to the Doepfer DIY method. But they still look quite cool and extremely usable, not to mention sturdy. Then there‚Äôs the brand new one by Yamaha. The Tenori-On allows both MIDI control and on-board audio, so it‚Äôs a bit of a different beast, and looks like it‚Äôs probably meant more for the mass-produce market than DIY‚Äôers. mmmm, think it‚Äôs time to get a doepfer?

    "body": "‚ÄúMusic collector‚Äù is probably how I would classify myself. Streaming music is good in a pinch (I prefer SomaFM when it comes to curated radio listening [disclaimer: my music is often in rotation on CliqHop]), but my primary source of listening is my modest personal collection: 300GB+ of digital files, a quarter of which are CD rips of only about a sixth of my dust-gathering CD folders, and thousands of vinyl records. I seek out things, I follow threads of interest, I pay attention to collaborators and studio players and remixers to find other things that might interest me. I am a crate digger because I love discovery.\nMy predilection while working is to random-play the ~3200 albums worth of tracks and shows I‚Äôve collected. Quite often I‚Äôm surprised because I have my own stuff in the rotation, and every once in awhile a track will come up, asNanotechno did the other day, that creates an ephemeral bubble of time travel. This time it took me back to when nobody had heard of DevOps.\nI recently had trouble describing what I meant when telling someone I come from a ‚Äúraw Operations‚Äù background. Partially this is to show a distinction from the arena of DevOps, but also that I have done a considerable amount of work with the ‚Äúraw‚Äù part of our infrastructure: the hardware. I got my start installing Sun servers at client locations while I was also doing primordial Java programming and graphic design for the same company. I graduated into NOC and SysAdmin and frankly never looked at software development again. I had stumbled onto my niche, hardware was awesome and I loved seeing it in action, and code became the perfect tool for a lot of jobs. I built datacenters and helped companies run things in them.\nWith music, I‚Äôve always been drawn to performance, to the practice of presentation and of the stage. I naturally drifted into the world of improvisational music. Composition interests me but I often find myself struggling over placing things. I‚Äôve recognized that I prefer the elegance of running things.\nThis might be controversial, but I feel that when people of an Ops mindset are running things, there is a strong ingrained desire to be careful of circumstance and context. Operators first think about things in line with how they run. Often the SRE and SysAdmins I admire and respect are also naturals at diving into and grokking complex systems on the first go. There are minds that fit in this space better than others, just like there are those predisposed to musical interpretation and performance over composition. It‚Äôs not better or worse, merely different.\nIn fact, I think the mind of the Ops works a lot like a musical performer. There‚Äôs a very visceral part of being oncall and dealing with incidents and things that are running in real-time ‚Äì like production services ‚Äì that maps directly to musical (not to mention theatrical) performance practice. The most unifying feature is the necessary property of Time, necessary for the emerging structure of all adaptive systems.\nDisavowment by NSEvery time I hear \"DevOps\" I think \"sysadmins who kept current and are collaborative peers instead of surly assholes.\" \u0026mdash; Corey Quinn (@QuinnyPig) \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1167867156060463104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\u0026quot;\u0026gt;August 31, 2019\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;    Adrienne‚Äôs bitter old ops guy\nDevOps was first introduced to me like Christianity was to Asia. On two separate occasions, it was a doused-in-kerosene experience where unilateral decisions were made by new leadership in a vacuum with ‚Äì and I cannot embolden this enough ‚Äì zero plan for proselytization or education. It was baptism by fire, with little questions asked about ‚Äúreal work‚Äù, but plenty of assumptions made, and no effort to soak in the socio-technical system at play.\nYou can imagine how I came to view DevOps. I‚Äôm as Ops as you can get, and one of my pillars of being Ops is that you work with Dev. Part of the job of running the system has always been heavy collaboration and cooperation with the people designing and building it.\nBut DevOps force-fed to you by people who themselves have an extremely shaky or completely wrong interpretation of it is just about the worst way to convince your senior Ops folks too busy with their heads in their jobs and not paying attention to bleeding-edge Development frameworks that they are now doing DevOps.\nSo, what is DevOps? To answer that question, I will refer to a slide I am extremely fond of from Sec-Sensei James Wickett (@wickett), to be read doing your best impression of Stuart Smalley from SNL:\nStuart Smalley slide\nOr if you prefer it without dripping irony, go no further than Ernest Mueller (@ernestmueller). For something more mind-expanding, try the abstract for Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity (but definitely read the paper, as well as John Allspaw (@allspaw) speaking about it).\nI have no place defining DevOps, even though I certainly have opinions and battle scars from it.\nA music term surfaced in the ‚Äò90s acronymed ‚ÄúIDM‚Äù which was taken through very narrow and very broad swaths of definition all at the same time. It was first meant to describe a particular style, but quickly as that style branched out to signify an entire class of musical approaches, so exploded confusion about the name. The phrase alone makes no sense, the individual words do not accurately describe anything, but give enough weight to make it a puzzle to understand. These elements seem to exist either separately or in conjunction depending on the music in question that has suffered the moniker.\nCalling a practice DevOps and not allowing for the needful distribution of Dev and Ops in various modes of autonomy and blending feels as disingenuous as calling something Intelligent Dance Music. They are both horrible terms for what I have noticed are very similar reasons. In specific contexts, it makes sense to use them because there simply is no other term that is in the common tongue. But the semiotics of both begin to disintegrate once qualifications become attached.\nThere are pieces of music out there that owe much more to their Dance nature than the internally looking Intelligent sound. The opposite is true, and there are works all the way up and down the spectrum in between. In terms of the genre, they all belong.\nI daresay DevOps suffers the same ambiguity when we try to nail the definition down and overprescribe it.\n",

    "body": "Creating things is a fundamental human activity. In music, it includes many things: composition, instrumentation, preparation, production, performance, presentation, recording, distribution, consumption, listening‚Ä¶ just to name a few. In fact, the expression of a piece of music can very quickly become a complex weave of tree-like dependencies, where many different disciplines ‚Äì and humans ‚Äì combine to create a unified work.\nOver time, technologies advanced quickly, and improvements to the various sub-fields within making a musical work crossed boundaries. The same people who composed were those performing, recording techniques spilled into how to prepare, those presenting found themselves producing. Now, technology enables a single person to encompass the entirety of what it took dozens of people to accomplish 50 years ago ‚Äì everything from creation to marketing to dissemination.\nThe result is a constantly changing industry, for sure, but the interesting essence here is the shape of change. One example that comes to mind is electronic music and the way that computer technology has driven the ability of the individual to control the entire lifecycle. A laptop can be an entire production studio and publication platform. The tools a musician uses to do this have become sufficiently abstracted that an entire world of expertise is no longer required. As the technology advances, it allows more to be done by more, the need for specialization decreases as the opportunity for wider adoption increases.\nOur population grows and with it the amount of creation. The nature of distribution and consumption in a heavily networked world means that cross-pollination increases exponentially, and soon we are overcome with such a huge variety of musical output and genre-bending that it becomes impossible to navigate. Even in terms of instrumentation and recording, details become abstracted and devices do a lot of the hard work under the hood.\nI liken this to the discipline of distributed computer systems not only because music has gone hand-in-hand with the development of the computer, but also that they share this phenomenon of ‚Äòdependent abstraction‚Äô.\nLet‚Äôs get concrete. Those with careers as recording and studio engineers have become proportionally few to the increasing number of people making music. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that there is less demand for recording engineers, only that a greater number of musicians are without the need for them as technology enables these people to do it right in their own home. It may not mean you‚Äôre getting the most high-end experience you can, but it‚Äôs definitely good enough to publish.\nSo what about the computer systems operations engineer? As the cloud and distributed systems become larger, software has been developed that allows a greater number of people to engage in the activity of application development and distribution. It has abstracted away the requirement to understand how specific components of the hardware works, for example. Entire complex systems are being delivered ‚Äúout-of-the-box‚Äù to run on cloud providers without any need for hiring an ops person, much less a team. While the need for operational expertise is still required, it pales in comparison to the demand for those who can build things on top the groundwork they provide.\n",

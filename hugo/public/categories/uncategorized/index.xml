      <description>The term disc jockey was first coined in 1935, referring of course to the phonograph discs that had become popular for recorded music. Forty years and dozens of musical genre shifts later, the Technics SL-1200 direct drive paved the way for turntablists, still concerned with round artifacts of engraved sound, but doing more live manipulation than just selecting and playing tunes.
Since then, it has come to signify any presentation of recorded music mixed for a listening audience.</description>

      <title>The Shocking Before and After of Remoteness</title>

      <description>I was once employed at a startup whose attitude about remote workers had begun to retrograde to the point where even simple tolerance of the practice became a hot point. Leadership was known to stroll through offices and make comments about how they didn’t see butts in seats, even frequenting some facilities on early morning Fridays just to scoff at the emptiness of the expansive “open floor plans” where interruptions and distractions were kept at a maximum.</description>

      <description>The flowers sort of peeked
out of the tops of glasses.
They appeared to be in water,
surviving only because the tender kept them wet.
Their smell wafted across the corner of the bar,
hint of basil, tarragon,
a combo that seemed like the mix
of bergamot and chocolate.
The color of the green leaves
almost sparkled in the setting sun,
as beads of new water drifted
across the cool curve of the tiny hurricane glasses,</description>

      <description>I’ve been clearing out shelves and digging through old notebooks, and came across this steno pad from the summer of 1998, exactly 20 years ago. I lived in the northern suburbs of DC, worked as a graveyard shift unix system administrator at a datacenter company called Digex, and hosted a radio show for two years while I studied in graduate school as a vocal student and specialist in experimental vocal music and opera performance.</description>

      <title>Remote Worker: A Primer</title>

      <description>I am the nerd who annoyed you as a roommate because I always had the phone line busy dialing into BBSes when you were pounding cheap beer to “jump up jump up and get down” in the living room, while I searched Usenet for pirated software and other nefarious files, loving the thrill of connecting to a different reality.
I am the music major geek at a largely engineering-focussed university that sat for hours at the library VAX/VMS amber-toned terminal using raw telnet to log into MUDs and MOOs, attempting RPG challenges, having “virtual sex” and all other kinds of things, collaborating on tracks, partying together as a community IRL, and creating some of the strongest friendships I have today.</description>

      <description>We own this D battery operated “mini organ” that has a real blower inside and some kind of reed system… I haven’t taken it apart yet to see, and somewhat afraid of breaking it, but it works and sounds really cool!</description>

      <description>Here we go… I’ve optimized the way I’m using power, love the way the dual jfet opamps (TL082) sound, and have the mixing elements mostly decided.
To be done on this prototype:
 use either capacitor switching or a simple 4017 sequencer to change up the textural possibilities of the oscillator add switches to the voice modulator to allow for “skipping around” pitches instead of only up or down changes CV input  I went through quite a few opamps before finally deciding on the dual jfets, and now I really dig how they’re working with the complex waveform of the four NAND gates (NTE4093)… I use it first as a multipole low-pass filter to shape the sound of the chained oscillators.</description>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2010/05/06/how-to-listen/</guid>
      <description>So much music. Nowhere to begin. Everywhere is a beginning, none end.
Ever felt overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of works out there? I do all the time, daily in fact. I tend to find new listening by discovery through association, especially through publishers and artists that cross stylistic boundaries. Sometimes I feel like I have a certain knack to picking things out, almost to the extent it feels random, but in context it really never is.</description>

      <title>Noise.io: The iPhone Synth</title>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2008/08/09/noiseio-the-iphone-synth/</guid>
      <description>The noiseforiphone looks promising as the worlds first official iphone synth, with FM synthesis and gestural parameter adjustment.
The folks over at Noise Addicts have a nice blog entry including video clips and some detailed description of the four-channel FM synthesis model called “Enhanced Subspace Frequency Modulation” (ESFM).
I like that they are purposefully limiting the synth to a monophonic tool instead of a polyphonic mess; it looks like a well thought-out and highly intuitive interface, and for $7 you can’t beat it.</description>

      <description>Once aspect of creativity I haven’t quite discovered how to manage is the navigation of intuition.
It strikes me that some are better than others at accessing this elusive part of the imagination. As a visceral experience it’s unmistakable, but the pathways to obtaining that level of immersion are not so clear.
Inspiration strikes at the most incredulous opportunity; sometimes it’s like a pull, like gravitation towards a goal not seen, being drawn into a feeling that is indescribable beyond the need to create.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite pastimes recently is surfing through social sites like last.fm, following neighbor and friend links to different people’s pages and friends and neighbors and so on and so on… it’s a fascinating and sometimes recursive journey through the tastes of like minded individuals.</description>

      <description>I am infused from all directions it seems, there is so much to do.
At times there seem to be so many directions that I cannot find a clear path; when I dream to be great at something, but feel I have no focus on anything.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed a slight change in interface on the blog here, it’s because I switched from the TWiki BlogPlugin to WordPress.
The basic reason is that although BlogPlugin is a great tool on TWiki, it’s not as fully featured as I’d like, and there is the overhead of several dependencies within TWiki. The latter reason is difficult to deal with between system crashes and other kinds of data loss, and instead of banging my head against infinite loops in perl ImageMagick, I opted to install WP.</description>

      <description>“Music collector” is probably how I would classify myself. Streaming music is good in a pinch (I prefer SomaFM when it comes to curated radio listening [disclaimer: my music is often in rotation on CliqHop]), but my primary source of listening is my modest personal collection: 300GB+ of digital files, a quarter of which are CD rips of only about a sixth of my dust-gathering CD folders, and thousands of vinyl records.</description>

      <description>I have a story to tell about DevOps.
I’m one of those people who pioneered the Internet. I don’t say that lightly or in jest. It is I, among many others, that began building the infrastructure and caring for myriad companies of the early “commercial” Internet, taking commerce, collaboration, design, and information sharing forward.
I’ll give you an idea. When I worked for GlobalCenter in the 1990s, I once walked by a cage our team had built that was something like 20ft square and contained a single rack in the middle, surrounded by box-fans.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite Miles Davis heads is this song where the bass leads the melody and everything else falls into place. I always liked this tune because the bass was the first voice, and you know the piece because of it. When I listen to – or in rare occasions play – this magnificent thing, I’m reminded of the simplicity of improvisation. How chord changes are chord changes, but a solo can be made of a single note.</description>

      <description>Creating things is a fundamental human activity. In music, it includes many things: composition, instrumentation, preparation, production, performance, presentation, recording, distribution, consumption, listening… just to name a few. In fact, the expression of a piece of music can very quickly become a complex weave of tree-like dependencies, where many different disciplines – and humans – combine to create a unified work.
Over time, technologies advanced quickly, and improvements to the various sub-fields within making a musical work crossed boundaries.</description>

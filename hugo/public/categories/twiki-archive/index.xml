      <description>Wednesday night I played after John Harrington’s Stop Time for their CD release party, you can hear the 2-hour set new on CraqueCast or download the full thing directly.
I also have several pictures from the gig for all to see… John moves ALL THE TIME so my little digital camera could never get a clean shot of him!
As many of you may know, I improvise all my DJ sets.</description>

      <description>My favorite live downtempo band – T Spigot – is back in action this year, and to start it off they’re offering the limited edition first pressing of Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Crime, available through paypal for a measly $5, so go get it!
The bonus is that this version of the album includes the remix of dubnbud which they did for the 12″ release of Trolling for Olives.</description>

      <description>Metatron Press (the website is slightly outdated, but not necessarily incorrect) has started a netlabel archive, posting releases formerly available only on CDR, as well as more new stuff to come.
A quintet I played in for some time called Gray Code now has a live recording up, from the 2000 Philadelphia Fringe Festival.
The name of the group is taken from the structure we often used to improvise: “In performances using the Gray Code structure for five players, we proceed through all the possible combinations of members of the group, including the silence that starts and ends the performance, five solos, ten duets, ten trios, five quartets, and the single quintet involving all the players.</description>

      <title>Tangent and an Improv Rig</title>

      <description>The synth used for my Feb 8 show at Dangerous Curve, incorporated in my live electro-acoustic rig. There’s a last.fm video of the show that actually has pretty decent sound!
What you see below is my homebuilt synth (three square wave oscillators fed through dual 2-pole lowpass filters, each metal box has an engage switch, tone control, and cutoff frequency) fed through (or not) a Boss AW-3 dynamic wah filter, an acoustic guitar contact microphone fed through (or not) an Audiobulb FZ-Bulb, a pocket shortwave radio, several found objects (near and in the tin can), and behind that a Line6 DL4, Electrix Repeater, Alesis Quadraverb and Behringer Xenyx 1622 mixer.</description>

      <title>New Release: Density Operator</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2008/01/20/new-release-density-operator/</link>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2008/01/20/new-release-density-operator/</guid>
      <description>Behold the appalling beautiful world of Density Operator now available on Stadtgruen.
“The title is program: everything in this world seems to be under pressure in order to extract the highest concentration of agility. Computer sounds are algorithms, just another form of mathematical strings. Thus the densification of sound works by finding the shortest possible expression.”
Music on this album picked its own paths and themes as it emerged from ideas I’ve had about quantum mechanics and atomic theory, and how the same conceptual mindspace is occupied by the intense spontaneity of improvisation.</description>

      <title>RIP: Loungeometry at the Kettle and the Keg</title>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2008/01/16/rip-loungeometry-at-the-kettle-and-the-keg/</guid>
      <description>In response to the many sad emails and messages about Loungeometry, the evident is true: Kettle and the Keg has decided on their own to forgo lounge music to try and bring in more customer base. Loungeometry has been discontinued.
At a certain level, the finger can be pointed at the City of Fullerton. Incentives for business to open downtown, efforts to revitalize and bring consumers into the city, extensive renovation projects and residential development… all these things have brought an enormous influx of people, and merchants are struggling to compete for their wallets in the only way they know how: bait them with popular culture.</description>

      <title>New on CraqueCast: Amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2008/01/09/new-on-craquecast-amalgamation/</link>

      <description>Starting off the new year with an archival live show: Amalgamation: Live at Smartbar, Chicago, 2002 is a set I did at SmartBar in March of 2002.
This is a set where I combined many influences, methods and directions together through a wide assortment of sampled objects, guitar playing, voices, and softsynths. It’s glitchy, ambient, dark, funky, beaty and bouncy all at the same time! A really nice listen with highly contrasting sections of sound and rhythm.</description>

      <description>Well I know you could just go through my Last.fm listening or whatever, but it doesn’t represent everything. So this isn’t a best-of by any stretch, just a viewfinder into what I’ve been listening to the past 3 weeks. They’re loosely grouped by category… I’ll let the reader decide how to categorize them.

      <title>The amazing things people say to a DJ</title>

      <description>I don’t know whether to call this sad or a sign of the times (surely it’s both), but if nothing else it certainly makes me feel on the fringe (of what, I am not sure) moreso than ever. Now I’ve noticed in particular that girls who come up asking if I take requests don’t listen to my answer and ask if I have this or that, or act surprised that I don’t have anything you can hear on the radio.</description>

      <title>Circuitbend ahoy!</title>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2007/12/08/circuitbend-ahoy/</guid>
      <description>I’ve now dived pretty headlong into the world of circuit bending and synthesis, and it’s hooked me. There’s a unique similarity between creating digital and analog sounds with circuits and finding sounds with microphones on objects, so I’m motivated on the ideas behind what one friend so rightly calls my “tinkering”. What’s on the bench now is a small, multi-oscillator synth, probably with a movable filter. This will sit some how on my ever-evolving soundboard and contribute to the medium.</description>

      <description>The CraqueCast for October/November 2007 features Matt Cooke-Davis (voice, sampled objects and electronics), Carol Genetti (voice) and Viv Corringham (voice) in a three-part free improvisation at The Nervous Center Festival of Electronic Music, Chicago 2002. Viv is a vocal experimenter from the UK who I met through Pauline Oliveros and the Deep Listening group, and has done some interesting work with ‘walkabout’ listening and binaural recording. Carol is a Chicago-area vocalist who has worked with many other free improvisors and electronic musicians, we met through the improv scene there and were excited to do some collaboration for the Nervous Center.</description>

      <title>So you wanna control buttons?</title>

      <description>Since I first started manipulating live samples, I’ve always wanted some kind of trigger surface that’s nothing but a bunch of dumb buttons that trigger samples via internal bank or MIDI. For a long time I’ve been using loopers and other devices to gather and playback samples. But nowadays I’m looking at changing around my live setup, and think I’d really like to add a ‘sample bank’ to the config so I can work with pre-made samples as well as live-sampled sounds.</description>

      <description>some recent releases on digital i’m enjoying. some brand new, some not so new, but they keep me coming back:   Kim Cascone has a special way of writing music like the sound of crumpling paper, here stratified by field recordings on The Astrum Argentum. I’m especially drawn to the sounds in this recording, especially how conscious-close they are to escaping all original form; the experienced listener expertly removes themselves from reality with kim’s music.</description>

      <description>Liz Revision, aka Quantazelle has a new DJ residency at Ramp Chicago, a monthly night at Sonotheque featuring “ambient, IDM, electro and quirky, glitchy techno.” Yes, good music remains alive in Chi-town!!! Congrats first off to Liz for the residency! If you know her music but don’t know her jewelry design, check out the goods at Fractalspin. I like them because she does similar things with jewelry that I’ve applied so some of my sculpture.</description>

      <description>If you’re in San Fran, do not miss the North American premiere of Brian Eno’s 77 Million Paintings exhibit at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts the weekend of June 29th. This looks like a fantastic thing, what’s even cooler is that it’s all done with Macs! You can also buy the work on DVD, but obviously it was meant for a grand space. Details of the event are on the Long Now Foundation website.</description>

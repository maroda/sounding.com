      <description>My favorite live downtempo band – T Spigot – is back in action this year, and to start it off they’re offering the limited edition first pressing of Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Crime, available through paypal for a measly $5, so go get it!
The bonus is that this version of the album includes the remix of dubnbud which they did for the 12″ release of Trolling for Olives.</description>

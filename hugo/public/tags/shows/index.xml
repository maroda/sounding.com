      <description>Here’s a live set from the guys at Erotus (Blamstrain’s new label) celebrating its launch, featured in the Viides Uuden Musiikin Festivaali, or “Fifth Festival for New Music”, held in Kupittaanpuisto, Turku, Finland.
Download it to hear area, asketix, blamstrain, ercola, and mk10 (not necessarily in that order) throw down a continuous two and a half hour set of glitch-filled, sometimes psychedelic, always atmospheric minimal techno from 25 July in Finland.</description>

      <description>Wednesday night I played after John Harrington’s Stop Time for their CD release party, you can hear the 2-hour set new on CraqueCast or download the full thing directly.
I also have several pictures from the gig for all to see… John moves ALL THE TIME so my little digital camera could never get a clean shot of him!
As many of you may know, I improvise all my DJ sets.</description>

      <description>Metatron Press (the website is slightly outdated, but not necessarily incorrect) has started a netlabel archive, posting releases formerly available only on CDR, as well as more new stuff to come.
A quintet I played in for some time called Gray Code now has a live recording up, from the 2000 Philadelphia Fringe Festival.
The name of the group is taken from the structure we often used to improvise: “In performances using the Gray Code structure for five players, we proceed through all the possible combinations of members of the group, including the silence that starts and ends the performance, five solos, ten duets, ten trios, five quartets, and the single quintet involving all the players.</description>

      <title>RIP: Loungeometry at the Kettle and the Keg</title>

      <description>In response to the many sad emails and messages about Loungeometry, the evident is true: Kettle and the Keg has decided on their own to forgo lounge music to try and bring in more customer base. Loungeometry has been discontinued.
At a certain level, the finger can be pointed at the City of Fullerton. Incentives for business to open downtown, efforts to revitalize and bring consumers into the city, extensive renovation projects and residential development… all these things have brought an enormous influx of people, and merchants are struggling to compete for their wallets in the only way they know how: bait them with popular culture.</description>

      <title>New on CraqueCast: Amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2008/01/09/new-on-craquecast-amalgamation/</link>

      <description>Starting off the new year with an archival live show: Amalgamation: Live at Smartbar, Chicago, 2002 is a set I did at SmartBar in March of 2002.
This is a set where I combined many influences, methods and directions together through a wide assortment of sampled objects, guitar playing, voices, and softsynths. It’s glitchy, ambient, dark, funky, beaty and bouncy all at the same time! A really nice listen with highly contrasting sections of sound and rhythm.</description>

      <title>Appearing in variety‚Ä¶</title>

      <description>Audiobulb has released a free sampler of music from eight artists on the label, including a track off Supple (see post below), subtly arranged and expertly mixed by label owner David Newman. Others included are: Jimmy Behan, Biosphere, Ultre, NQ, Mark Harris, Hans van Eck and He Can Jog. I‚Äôm honored to be among the talent in that lineup, and the music is just awesome.
Also recently, Xynthetic produced their Second Statement, a stunning cross-section of the artist roster that displays the wide variety to be had on the netlabel.</description>

      <title>‚ÄúSupple‚Äù out now on Audiobulb</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2009/04/07/supple-out-now-on-audiobulb/</link>

      <description>Presenting: an electro-acoustic album of experimental sound sources and improvisations punctuated by iterative percussion, i.e. glitchy ambient slightly funky dance music. üòâ
Supple is the way I‚Äôve seen things come together over several years after moving to California, and owes some to dance forms that made this area of the country so important to electronic music development and culture. They are presented in a sort of story-form (I‚Äôll blame my operatic tendencies for that), where endings and beginnings aren‚Äôt so easily discerned, and overall structure blends them in a sort of high-contrast, watercolor way‚Ä¶ which I think is matched in visual form by gl0tch (check out the release page to see different versions of the cover art morphing), giving it all this primordial evolutionary cybernetic aspect that I love, as if everything is a petri dish of mechanically chaotic musical questions.</description>

      <title>Downtempo from the Studio</title>

      <description>I‚Äôve set up a set in Soundcloud called ‚ÄúDowntempo Excursions‚Äù to post some sonic paintings created with free improvisation and minimal beats.
 Let me know what you think! These are sort of what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúcomposting‚Äù of materials, kaleidoscopically tapestristic, experimentally structured.</description>

      <title>Coming soon‚Ä¶ Craque on Audiobulb</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2008/12/17/coming-soon-craque-on-audiobulb/</link>

      <description>So my new full-length album, Supple, will be released by Audiobulb in March of 2009. Ain‚Äôt that awesome! It‚Äôs a real honor to be joining in the ranks of Autistici, HeCanJog, Ultre, Calika, and so many others.
Months have gone by (actually, no, YEARS) where I have absorbed things, seen new parts of the world, learned new techniques, sought out what‚Äôs further; and this album evolved alongside me. The entire work has grown from single tracks and loose groupings to continuity and connection through thematic reverberation, it‚Äôs been fun and full of discovery.</description>

      <title>Craque: ‚ÄúTekuchesti‚Äù out now on Constanta</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2008/10/03/craque-tekuchesti-out-now-on-the-constanta-netlabel/</link>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2008/10/03/craque-tekuchesti-out-now-on-the-constanta-netlabel/</guid>
      <description>I‚Äôm very happy to announce the release of a project I did this summer called Tekuchesti (a transliteration of —Ç–µ–∫—É—á–µ—Å—Ç–∏, which is a Russian word meaning ‚Äúfluidity‚Äù), a piece in shuffle time for listeners and improvisers.
Download the entire work, and remember to listen on shuffle. Weird request you say? Read the liner notes below for more detail‚Ä¶
Please also visit the release page at Constanta and check out the other artists on this new boutique netlabel, which features some unique approaches to the microsound/glitch/experimental/drone genres; beauty through subtlety and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Craque: ‚ÄúTrolling for Olives‚Äù now free download</title>
      <link>https://sounding.com/2008/10/02/craque-trolling-for-olives-now-free-download/</link>

      <guid>https://sounding.com/2008/10/02/craque-trolling-for-olives-now-free-download/</guid>
      <description>In 2001 the debut 12‚Ä≥ for Craque titled Trolling for Olives EP was released on Metatron Press, and now it‚Äôs available for free on last.fm.
All five tracks are both streamable and downloadable, I figured I‚Äôd do them all since the original is still available for purchase on vinyl and it‚Äôs got some dope tracks!
And I don‚Äôt know how many of my fans actually read this, but here‚Äôs the first hint that you can expect several new releases coming up in the coming months.</description>

      <description>I’ve decided to pull all my sculpture and art photography here to a central gallery, and have a new page for my sculpture that for now features most of the photos I have up on Deviant Art.
There’s a couple of new large works going, one that’s nearly complete and another just begun, photos to come soon!</description>

      <description>Here we go… I’ve optimized the way I’m using power, love the way the dual jfet opamps (TL082) sound, and have the mixing elements mostly decided.
To be done on this prototype:
 use either capacitor switching or a simple 4017 sequencer to change up the textural possibilities of the oscillator add switches to the voice modulator to allow for “skipping around” pitches instead of only up or down changes CV input  I went through quite a few opamps before finally deciding on the dual jfets, and now I really dig how they’re working with the complex waveform of the four NAND gates (NTE4093)… I use it first as a multipole low-pass filter to shape the sound of the chained oscillators.</description>

      <description>Here’s something I thought I’d never see myself do in my own lifetime: build a synthesizer from scratch.
Actually it’s a simple design: 2 555 timers in astable configuration producing square-waves. This means it’s a burst of sound every interval, pretty annoying and not very useful except for maybe starting earthquakes. So to give it a little flavor, I put a low-pass, 2-pole filter on the output of each oscillator, using a traditional operational amplifier.</description>

      <description>I’m excited to be waiting on the arrival of my new Bleep Labs ThingamaKIT.
Not unlike the simple improvising synth I’ve been working on with VCOs and 2-pole filters, this is a DIY version of their photo-sensitive thingamagoop, described on their website as simply:
“The Thingamagoops have oscillators just like any synth. On analog synths the oscillator that creates the actual tone you hear is called a VCO or voltage controlled oscillator.</description>

      <description>The synth used for my Feb 8 show at Dangerous Curve, incorporated in my live electro-acoustic rig. There’s a last.fm video of the show that actually has pretty decent sound!
What you see below is my homebuilt synth (three square wave oscillators fed through dual 2-pole lowpass filters, each metal box has an engage switch, tone control, and cutoff frequency) fed through (or not) a Boss AW-3 dynamic wah filter, an acoustic guitar contact microphone fed through (or not) an Audiobulb FZ-Bulb, a pocket shortwave radio, several found objects (near and in the tin can), and behind that a Line6 DL4, Electrix Repeater, Alesis Quadraverb and Behringer Xenyx 1622 mixer.</description>

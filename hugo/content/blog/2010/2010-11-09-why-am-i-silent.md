Incredibly, when I was a young boy I assumed everyone was supposed to know everything. It wasn&#8217;t until I was probably 30 that I realized things are meant to be learned and practiced, never known outright or assumed to be perfect.

But I spent a long time growing up thinking the opposite, that because I didn&#8217;t know something meant I couldn&#8217;t belong.

When I was thirteen, between finishing _<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lord_of_the_rings" target="_blank">The Lord of the Rings</a>_ and discovering _<a href="http://www.playboy.com/mostpopular/index.html" target="_blank">Playboy</a>_, I locked onto a character in David Eddings&#8217;s _<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Belgariad" target="_blank">The Belgariad</a>_; a wizardly type bloke who espoused silence and the ability to listen, leaving speech to those who knew not how to think. I locked step, it made sense. There wasn&#8217;t ever a time I felt like speaking up in a crowd, my opinions didn&#8217;t seem that important, and for some reason my brain always seemed busy doing other things, so speaking up is never a real priority for me.

What does this mean in the long run? There are a lot of times when I think I am incubating some genius, that there is buried deep within my soul a discovery I could only make by living this long&#8230; up until now nobody has caught on, if I am truly guided by intuition. Or am I? I wonder if I have already encountered my own _<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzcarraldo" target="_blank">Fitzcarraldo</a>_, or if it has yet to come; my instinct is that it is in the near future.

Even so it scares me to jump into something as if it were the last promontory of the final peak of some long meandering cliffside where I haven&#8217;t learned anything but where to go next, can I reach that handhold just beyond my grasp. There are moments where I can see clearly into the future, precisely recognize a moment or passion, but it soon falls away into a sense of loss, where I cannot understand the pathway to that end.

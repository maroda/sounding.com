# Room Music

An Oaken Table with Oaken Chairs\
Sits inhabited by throes of Imagination.\
They converse, they watch,\
they wonder at the wetness of the Rain.

Neon Ice-Cream Cone leans agains the corner,\
comtemplating the ripples in his creamy cheeks.\
Beside him Day Lily sings,\
and provides a sweet aroma to her company.

Napkin Holder watches both sides of the table,\
asking Pepper why Salt is so tart,\
and telling Salt that Pepper can be a little\
hot-headed at times.

Coffee Mug sits ceramically,\
placing oh so carefully a ring of satin stain\
on the table's shiny finish.

Soda-Pop sits empty,\
wanting just a small amount\
of gratification from a silky pair of lips.

Sugar pouts nearby,\
lost in his self-pity,\
watching his reflection\
in the table's shiny finish.

String-Puppet hangs\
from the ceiling,\
watching it all\
and wondering,\
is this real?

# I travel light

<p style="text-align:center">
I travel light,<br>
myself and my pack.<br>
Through forests of dreams<br>
and fields of cotton<br>
we walk.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
There are theives<br>
that climb atop my pack,<br>
little sprites and spirits:<br>
they give sometimes,<br>
but mostly take.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
There are points<br>
along our travel<br>
when I look upon<br>
my weathered sack<br>
and all I've left<br>
is a song.
</p>

# For Sight

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Echoes bound from Future\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;turning endlessly upon his back,\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and hit with stunning accuracy\
the gem of worry.

# As Dusk

See me no more\
&emsp;&emsp;The sky no longer stares\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In rainy contemplation\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At the bolemic earth below.

Words and phrases mean nothing.\
&emsp;&emsp;Tell us your thoughts.\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sing.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Orange.

Sunburst in scarlet.

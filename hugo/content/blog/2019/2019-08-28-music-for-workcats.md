I have a few Slacks (as in chats, not pants) with #music and #jams channels where I feel obligated to post music I find good. I love sharing music. It&#8217;s why I got involved and loved my years on WUVT and WMUC DJ&#8217;ing, why I have always had a side-&#8216;job&#8217; as a DJ, why I made mixtapes in high school and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/m3n3lq2r460fplk/craque-thecollective-192_20180604.mp3?dl=0" target="_blank">recordings</a> of my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6nt1mhpljimwpd5/craque-loungeometry_20061123a.mp3?dl=0" target="_blank">sets</a> to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9wm80lv9mioi3d5/craque_theglassshow_20170211-192.mp3?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">share</a>.

This was going to be a tweet thread but turned into something longer. So as a peek behind the scenes, here&#8217;s how&#8217;s my workday sonic rotation works!

### The Sonic Atmosphere

There are a lot of times I have nothing playing, but I am listening to what&#8217;s around me, inside and out. Often I go on listening walks for both meditation and exercise. I might even pick up an instrument in my studio and play a bit.

### Do I have it on vinyl?

If I think of something, like a style or a specific artist, I will first check the stax of wax. It could be anything from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Zappa (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa" target="_blank">Zappa</a> to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="John Cage (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage" target="_blank">John Cage</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autechre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Autechre</a> to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_Fischer-Dieskau" target="_blank">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a>.

#### Is it easily accessible vinyl?

This is actually a requirement of the previous item, except that it will depend entirely on the artist or piece in question. If I have a hankering for an original UK release of an early &#8217;70s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethro_Tull_(band)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Jethro Tull</a> album, I&#8217;m gonna have to hit the big shelves.

### Do I want random play?

Then it&#8217;s to iTunes, hit random, ~2600 albums worth of tracks can show up in any order the pseudo-random (it plays repeats a LOT) algorithm chooses. The fun part here, of course, is family members experiencing the avant-garde nature of a huge swath of my collection (e.g. Merzbow&#8217;s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.discogs.com/Merzbow-Karasu-13-Japanese-Birds-Pt-4/release/1741296" target="_blank"><em>13 Japanese Birds: Karasu</em></a> just came on random followed by a track from _<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.discogs.com/DJ-John-Kelley-FunkyDesertBreaks/release/58612" target="_blank">Funky Desert Breaks</a>_).

### Do I want a specific artist or style _not_ on vinyl?

Self-explanatory I think. If I have the artist on vinyl, that wins. If I don&#8217;t have it, I check my digital collection. Very rarely I will come across something I know I have somewhere in 500+ CDs but not on-disk and I&#8217;ll take that chance to rip it.

### Do I want a specific artist I don&#8217;t have or want more of?

The first place I check is _<them>.bandcamp.com_, then a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.discogs.com" target="_blank">Discogs</a> search. YouTube helps with more obscure stuff, too. Pro tip: if you&#8217;re sharing music, check if it&#8217;s on <a href="https://craque.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Bandcamp</a> first! Tracks are all embeddable.

### On the BBQ porch with only an internet-connected streaming device?

That&#8217;s easy: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://somafm.com/" target="_blank">Somafm</a>. My go-to is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://somafm.com/cliqhop/" target="_blank">Cliqhop</a> or Groove Salad(s). Drone Zone is always great too, and some of the loungey stuff is great dinner music. I also never miss <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Wait Wait Don&#8217;t Tell Me</a>.

### What I don&#8217;t do?

I don&#8217;t buy streaming services. I <a href="https://somafm.com/support/donate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">donate to Somafm</a>, I use my own collection. I won&#8217;t bother listing them, but there are some I won&#8217;t even use embedded. I&#8217;m pretty firmly on the David Crosby and Marc Ribot side of this argument.

### That&#8217;s it!

Easy enough, but I do have a huge collection to my advantage. I understand that streaming services are very easy for a large majority of people to be exposed to new music, but this is why I share. Hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/dtauvdiodr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="twitter (opens in a new tab)">twitter</a> if you want some more music suggestions!

Behold the appalling beautiful world of **Density Operator** now available on <a href="http://www.stadtgruenlabel.net/index.php?locator=releases&id=41" target="_blank">Stadtgruen</a>.

&#8220;The title is program: everything in this world seems to be under pressure in order to extract the highest concentration of agility. Computer sounds are algorithms, just another form of mathematical strings. Thus the densification of sound works by finding the shortest possible expression.&#8221;

Music on this album picked its own paths and themes as it emerged from ideas I&#8217;ve had about quantum mechanics and atomic theory, and how the same conceptual mindspace is occupied by the intense spontaneity of improvisation.

Album art done by Walter Montes de Oca is a spectacular accompaniment to the sound, merging organization and chaos in a beautifully simple manner.

There&#8217;s some nice things being written about the album:

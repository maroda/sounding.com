[<img class="alignright" title="Noise.IO screenshot" src="http://noise.io/nio-screen2.jpg" alt="" width="200" />][1]The <a href="http://noise.io" target="_blank"><strong>noise</strong>for<strong>i</strong>ph<strong>o</strong>ne</a> looks promising as the worlds first official iphone synth, with FM synthesis and gestural parameter adjustment.

The folks over at Noise Addicts have a nice <a href="http://www.noiseaddicts.com/2008/08/iphone-synth-gestural-fm-synthesis-noiseio/" target="_blank">blog entry</a> including video clips and some detailed description of the four-channel FM synthesis model called &#8220;Enhanced Subspace Frequency Modulation&#8221; (ESFM).

I like that they are purposefully limiting the synth to a monophonic tool instead of a polyphonic mess; it looks like a well thought-out and highly intuitive interface, and for $7 you can&#8217;t beat it.

Comes out later in August, should be a fantastic addition to [the rig][2]. I used to have an old yamaha pseudo-FM synth, lost it in the move from Chicago to LA. It will be fantastic to have FM-type synthesis at my fingertips again.

## Synesthesia

For about a year I was a resident DJ and wacko electro-acoustic IDM artist with this promotion collective, playing at a small but well-furnished club on a corner near Wicker Park. We also did underground and warehouse parties, I performed live for art installations and gallery events quite often; you can hear one of these "live PA" sets on [bandcamp](https://craque.bandcamp.com/album/live-craque-bigwig-synesthesia-i). These are two DJ sets when I played at the club.

### Club Bigwig, 2001.10.18

A very eclectic set that shifts between minimalism, dub, experimental, ambient, and deep house.

### Club Bigwig, 2001.11.08

<img src="bigwig-20011108.png" width=270px><p>
A rare trip-hop, idm, drum-n-bass, two-step outing. I play stuff like this plenty, but I think this might be the only recording of a full breakbeat set. Later on I started getting much more stylistically diverse.

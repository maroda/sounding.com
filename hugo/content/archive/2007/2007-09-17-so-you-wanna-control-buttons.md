Since I first started manipulating live samples, I&#8217;ve always wanted some kind of trigger surface that&#8217;s nothing but a bunch of dumb buttons that trigger samples via internal bank or MIDI. </p> 

For a long time I&#8217;ve been using loopers and other devices to gather and playback samples. But nowadays I&#8217;m looking at changing around my live setup, and think I&#8217;d really like to add a &#8216;sample bank&#8217; to the config so I can work with pre-made samples as well as live-sampled sounds. </p> 

<img src="https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/plugins/wp-o-matic/cache/dc695_A100_Mini_CTM64.jpg" align="right" width="50%" /> There&#8217;s a few interesting companies I&#8217;ve found, one of course I&#8217;ve looked at for several years for some kind of modular setup of my own: the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.doepfer.de/ctm.htm">Doepfer CTM series</a> is along the lines of what I&#8217;ve been wanting. And now they have a cool &#8216;Mini&#8217; enclosure to bring down the cost, cool huh? </p> 

A similar device, specific to MIDI button control is being produced by <a target="_blank" href="http://monome.org/series/">Monome</a>, though they have a limited product line with not so comparable prices to the Doepfer DIY method. But they still look quite cool and extremely usable, not to mention sturdy. </p> 

Then there&#8217;s the brand new one by Yamaha. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.global.yamaha.com/tenori-on">Tenori-On</a> allows both MIDI control and on-board audio, so it&#8217;s a bit of a different beast, and looks like it&#8217;s probably meant more for the mass-produce market than DIY&#8217;ers. </p> 

mmmm, think it&#8217;s time to get a doepfer? </p>

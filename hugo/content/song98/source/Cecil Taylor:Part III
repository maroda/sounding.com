The twenty-nine year leap from Unit Structures to the present isnot meant to imply that there was no development in Taylor's music duringthat period rather there was a continuous development, but the focusremained the same. Rather than undergoing dramatic stylistic shifts, such asJohn Coltrane had done, Taylor continued to refine and develop his musicalong the same principles that he had espoused in Unit Structures. Theperformance of the Orchestra at the San Francisco Jazz Festival representsone of the most recent, and arguably one of the most complex, manifestationsof the ideology that shaped his musical formulations from the mid-sixtiesonward.the 1995 jazz festival orchestraOf the 42 musicians who performed in the "Cecil Taylor Orchestra" at the SFJazz Festival, most were local, although a few players from Taylor's NewYork group were present. The skill levels of the players varied quite a bit,as did their familiarity with Taylor's music. We rehearsed for a week beforethe performance, for about six hours each rehearsal.structure and notationThere were about four or five "pieces" in total, the two main ones brokendown into 15 and 32 sections respectively. We seldom rehearsed the piecesall the way through. The scores (photocopies appear in the appendix) wereusually dictated by Taylor, and we wrote them down using his "letternotation," in which the letter names of the notes are written on plain whitepaper, the vertical and horizontal axes corresponding respectively to pitchand sequence. For example, a C triad arpeggiated up and down would looklike:                                   [Image]Larger leaps were usually indicated by a line, often with the correspondinginterval number. For example, a leap from C to E a twelfth above would bewritten:                                   [Image]Simultaneities were written on top of each other: [Image]It should be mentioned that, since the familiarity with Taylor's musicvaried quite a bit between musicians, many musicians had some difficulty inkeeping up with Taylor's rapid and rather quiet dictation. He also gave ustwo photocopied score pages which were written in the style described above.The musicians were arranged in instrumental sections, and the differentlines or chords of the compositions were each assigned to a particularsection. There was never any attempt to form smaller choirs of varyinginstrumentation, such as one trumpet, one tenor saxophone, and one violin;rather it always worked that all the trumpets, tenors or violins would playat the same time. While Taylor occasionally commented on the rhythm orphrasing of a passage, or structured it in some way (play forward twice thenretrograde once, for example), most often the various instrumental sectionswere left to determine how to play the passage. He had told us "I'm notfavorably impressed with conducting, so I would like you to discuss withyour section how you might proceed." He occasionally gave instructions ornew material composed on the spot to sections individually, so that it wassometimes difficult to gain a complete understanding of all the material.There was no "conductor score" which contained all of the parts.the rehearsal processThe rehearsals consisted mainly of playing through the various sections ofthe scores in a linear fashion. It took several days for the less familiarplayers to understand the character of the material given them, namely thateach instrumental section had a certain amount of control over theirphrases. Each instrumental section did not simply need to play through agiven phrase once, but rather could organize or orchestrate their playingwithin the score section to create more variety, mostly along the lines ofaccelerating the repetitions of the phrase and/or playing it in retrograde.Taylor said that "We will decide how the sounds pleases us, and we willdevelop them as we go along." There were no designated "solos" in thetraditional sense, although sometimes individual lines would becomeprominent.It should also be noted that the instrument sections were often given wordsor phrases to chant or vocalize. The manner of the vocalizations was subjectto the same manipulation that the instrumental lines were. For example, themost extensively orchestrated vocal part consisted of the wordsANO-DOR-HYN-CHUS,1 of which Taylor said: "Each participle has meaninganotherform of music, music that comes from the way you pronounce the word."Finally, we were instructed in one composition (section 15, p.2 of the scorethat begins with the violin chord G, F#, F, E) to move about the space. Wewere told to begin in positions of our choosing, move about, and then returnto our starting positions, in what Taylor called the "physicality of theinner dialogue."While some musicians expressed uneasiness with the vocalizations and themovement, the group generally became comfortable with the compositions. Withthe consistent linear reading of the scores, we had established a kind ofgroup identity: We understood the orchestra as an entity which performedthese scores in a linear fashion, and had clear, established roles asindividuals within that entity. Each performer knew her or his specifiedrole within their instrument section, and how that instrument sectionrelated to the orchestra as a whole and our progression through the scorematerial. There was a clear sense of the limited freedom allowed. Each piecewould progress as a kind of semi-determinate orchestral composition, on amicroscopic level subject to individual variation, but macroscopically fixedin a strict sequence of events. Performed in this linear manner, the pieceswere actually quite conservative structurally, although the sonorities werecomplex and the vocalizations unusual and recondite. This prompted onemusician to comment to me that the compositions "sound[ed] like contemporarymusic." I took this strange comment to mean the popular conception of"contemporary music in the Western Art tradition" as complex and dissonant,but still performed in a strict, linear note-by-note fashion. Thisparticular musician is well schooled in jazz, but has had little experiencewith the wide variety of forms contemporary music actually takes. An ensuingdiscussion prompted another musician to compare these compositions to thework of Edgard Varése, and another said that he was reminded of KarlheinzStockhausen. These reactions pointed up an interesting and important aspect:As stated above, these compositions, while often quite beautiful andenjoyable to play, were rather conservative formally, and to a large extentseemed to abandon the musical and artistic formulations Taylor begandeveloping in the sixties. For instance, the phrases he gave each sectionwere not "anacruses" upon which to "mirror the inner light" as described inthe Unit Structure's liner notes; rather they were short passages, a limitedsectional input into a larger, rather rigidly structured whole. It seemed hewas more or less fulfilling the traditional European model of"composer"composing a score in isolation which would be realized by theagents of the orchestra. While the performers were given more freedom thanthey would have been in a traditional symphony orchestra, and there was noconductor to "transform" the "symbols," the differences between "academy'spodium angle" and the music we had been rehearsing, especially inretrospect, seem more cosmetic that anything else. I began to wonder if hewas somehow trying to justify his music along the "European canonical"lineswas he trying to create a jazz equivalent to Varése? And if he wasinviting that comparison, did the comparison really hold up? It seemed quiteout of character for him to invite such comparisons in the first place.In retrospect, I think the rehearsal process fulfilled certain assumptionsand expectations that many of the musicians (myself included) had brought tothe music.2 The comment that it "sounds like contemporary music," forexample, demonstrates the expectation and justification of the musicfunctioning along the lines discussed above, that is a "jazz" version ofVarése. These considerations aside, the framework created for the variedgroup of 42 musicians did work in giving each player a certain amount offreedom while fulfilling a clearly assigned role in the orchestra. Ourrelationship to the music and to each other, our identity as a group, wasclear.the final rehearsalAll of this, of course, radically changed in the concert. The first hint ofwhat was to come came at the end of the final rehearsal. While variousinstrument sections were rehearsing their parts, the general noise level ofthe room was quite loud, and several of the tenor sax players began freeimprovising together. One of the percussionists joined in, and within tenminutes the whole orchestra had erupted into an unorganized jam, everyoneplaying at once at full volume. Taylor sat down at the piano and played forabout fifteen or so minutes in the midst of this. The music continued forclose to an hour, until it was time for us to give up the rehearsal space.It should also be noted that not all the musicians participated in the jam;several simply put away their instruments and seemed annoyed at theproceedings. Several left before it was over.As we left the rehearsal, one of the musicians said to me "Wow, I guess wereally needed to let off some steam." He was referring to the long, focusedhours of playing through the scores, an activity which is not traditional,and rather confining, for jazz players, particularly those that most oftendo "free" improvisation. The confinement to the given material hadeliminated the "Plain" of group improvisation; there was no chance for anykind of advancement into "an unknown totality, made whole through selfanalysis (improvisation)."Additionally, there was an uncertainty as to what exactly was going tohappen at the concert. Up until the last rehearsal, we were uncertainwhether Taylor was going to perform with the group at all; it had beensuggested that he was going to perform solo in the first set, and that wewould play the second set. When we left the final rehearsal, we had beentold by Peter Apfelbaum and India Cooke, who were responsible for organizingthe musicians, that Taylor would perform with us on the concert, but nothingwas said as to the ordering of pieces and whether Taylor would perform solo.How the actual performance was going to proceed was still unclear.Finally, the "steam" was also due to a certain amount of disappointmentwithin the group that no one was really getting a chance to "play withCecil." The desire to "play with Cecil" itself was complexit was an artisticdesire to play with a powerful and historically important musician, a desireto have one's "talent" recognized and affirmed by an established artist."Playing with Cecil" was also a potential career advancement if he decidedto use you as a member of his small group, the "Unit;" working with the"Unit" is one of the few gigs for "avant garde jazz" musicians that pays aliving wage, and is highly prized economically as well as artistically.The end of that final rehearsal demonstrated the disparity between whatseemed expected of us as orchestra members, and our individual desires andexpectations. The resulting tension, for so many days controlled by theordered structuring of the scores which asserted group identity above allelse, had finally erupted in what seemed like an anarchic convulsion ofindividual expression.instructions for the performanceThis tension became the center of the performance. When we arrived at YerbaBuena center a couple of hours before the concert, and after we had set upour chairs and arranged the seating (Taylor's piano was set up a little leftof center stage, a little behind the clarinets but in front of theguitarists and percussionist, placing him truly in the heart of theorchestra), we played through a few sections of the scores and then Taylorgave us some instructions for the performance. We were told to take all thechairs off stage. The performance was to begin with Taylor reading somepoetry and we were to enter the stage and move about slowly without ourinstruments, although the percussionists could play throughout. Thevocalists were given some phrases to perform, and we were told we couldvocalize as well if we desired. When Taylor spoke a specific passage (Ibelieve it was "circles turning"), we were to arrange ourselves into variousgeometric designs. Some players noted that the designs related to thearchitecture of the auditorium. We were to then continue moving about thespace, slowly bringing our chairs on stage, dragging them across the floorto produce sound. After this, Taylor was to begin playing the piano, atwhich point we were either to leave the stage or at least stop moving. Aftera bit of his solo playing, the percussionists and guitarists would join him,and then the rest of the orchestra would reenter the stage. When we were allfinally in place with our instruments, we would commence with the firstcomposition, which would be the one labeled "A," which contains the words"ANO-DOR-HYN-CHUS" discussed above. There was no instruction as to how wewere to proceed after that.the performanceThe beginning of the first set more or less followed the structure describedabove, which lasted for about the first twenty-five minutes. Each idea, themovement, the chanting, began to become more more expanded by individualplayers; for example a couple string players brought their instruments withthem. Taylor himself often departed from what he said he was going to do,wandering on and off stage- which someone later described as "playingpeek-a-boo."3 When the orchestra returned to the stage after Taylor had beenplaying solo for a while, several of the horn players began improvising withhim. Taylor stopped playing and wandered off stage, and the improvisationdied down after a few minutes, at which point the strings began theirtremolo on the note A, which begins the composition. A fair amount ofimprovisationhorns trading phrases, Taylor and others chanting,percussionists filling,continued over the beginning. When the firstcomposition finally began, Taylor played constantlyan individual voice setagainst the community identity. The progression through the piece was fitfuland slow; nobody was exactly sure how to proceed, and the progression keptbreaking down as Taylor, or someone else, would interject themselves whilethe group tried to figure out what to do. Rather than progress in a smoothand orderly fashion as we had done in rehearsal, the unexpectedinterjections of Taylor and others caused the progression to becomedisjunct, leaping from once place to another when members of oneinstrumental section would recognize cues from other sections.Analysis of Tape Selection 1A good example of the way the orchestra began to operate in the performanceis in sections 10-13 of the composition labeled "A" (the first selection onthe tape, which begins in section 10the reader may also wish to refer to thegraphic diagram Tape Selection 1 in the appendix, which may help withfurther clarification), which began about 40 minutes into the first set. Theorchestration of sections 10-12, a layering of the lines from differentinstrumental sections, had a certain building character to it, and withTaylor's insistent playing against this material, this feeling wasaugmented. About midway through section 12, there was a high "cry" from oneof the saxophones, and over the next twenty seconds their was a dissolutionof the score the tenors continued their line briefly as other players joinedthe screaming saxophone, then the tenors finally abandoned it as the wholeorchestra erupted into a group improvisation, reminiscent of our finalrehearsal, for about a minute and a half. The climax was punctuated by aseries of high Bs then C's from the trumpets and a couple saxes. When theystopped, the improvisation quickly ended with a whoop and a loud descendingseries of clusters from Taylor.After this outburst, there was a moment of pause while the orchestrareoriented itself, and the violins began section 13 with a glissando from Cup to C a couple octaves up, informing the rest of the players what we weredoing next. The tenors then came in clearly with their material, the altoshit their first chord. Taylor had been vocalizing against this material (attimes not audible on the tape), and vocalist (Trudy Morse) begins singing"ORA," which was from the opening vocalizations. This unsteadied theensemble a bit, and the strings began their chord (D#, D, C#) without thetrumpets. Hearing this chord prompted the trombones and piano (me) to beganplaying our E-F diads. The numbers 4 3 2 refer to repetitions of the chords(four times, three times, then two times), which we clearly articulate(although not as together as we could be). The trombones continued withtheir next passage, the glissandi, while I continued with material based onthe diads, as indicated by the words "continue till basses," which refers tothe phrase below the dotted line which begins C up to E flat. The tenors andtrombones continued through their next two phrases, but when the altos camein (E up to F below the dotted line), one of them, Marco Eneidi, began animprovised phrase based on the rising motif, but did so in a way that wasconnected to the material given by the piano. This began a brief groupimprovisation which started among the altos, but quickly spread to the othersaxes and to the guitars, while the tenors continued with their descending Dto G line beneath the improvisation. When this burst quickly died down witha sigh from one of the vocalists (Ijoema Thomas), Taylor came in with theword "endlessness." There was a pause, with a few vocalizations, as theorchestra attempted to assimilate the meaning of this outburst, and how toproceed. The basses continued after a moment with their line, thepercussionist's 4-3-2-1 pattern abandoned. The line itself was not totallyclear (compare it with the clarity of the tenor and trombone lines at thebeginning of the section). As they continued, some of the players tremoloed,reminiscent of the pedal A at the beginning of the piece, and there was somesparse vocalization from other members of the orchestra. The line did notend clearly either; there was no definite B-flat, A-flat, D-flat chord tomark the end of section 13. The cymbal sound, which was supposed to beginsection 14, did not enter, and the identity of the group was once againsuspended. After a moment, some of the players began the clapping, whichaccording to the score, was supposed to follow a percussion section withcymbals, glockenspiel, and sticks. The clapping itself rippled across theorchestra, but became disorganized and dissipated rather than becoming afocusing event, and soon the strings entered with a line from an entirelydifferent composition.What becomes evident from such a close examination of these few minutes ofmusic is that the orchestra itself was struggling for its identity. Ourunderstanding of our roles within the music, our intent to play the scoresstraight through with limited freedom, had been shattered by Taylor's lackof instruction, the addition of further vocalizations and movement at thelast minute, and his consistent layering of his own piano playing andvocalizations against what the orchestra was doing called into question ourroles as individuals and as a group. The group identity was vacillatingbetween an anarchic collection of individuals expressing themselvessimultaneously, and an orderly orchestra progressing through the fixed musicwe had rehearsed for many hours before. At the times when our formeridentity seemed poised to take over, Taylor or any other member of theorchestra asserted some kind of individuality against, though notnecessarily in opposition to, the orchestra as a whole. These assertionspushed the orchestra in one direction or another; the cry from the saxophoneat the end of section 12 pushed the group toward individuality, the violins'glissandi at the beginning of section 13 reasserted our identity as anorchestra. Marco's entrance in section 13 worked right in betweenhisassertion was orchestrated by the score, but his choice of how to proceed,by picking up on the energy of the piano and the extreme manipulation thepitch material given to him, led us on a course right between the extremes.Each member, then, became free to participate or not participate as she orhe wished, and acceptance of group identity became one among a myriad ofoptions.the rest of the first setThe section discussed above took place right at the end of the instructionsgiven to us by Taylor. After the end of the composition, there was no placegiven to go. However, as I hope I have demonstrated, the way we progressedup until that point provided a direction in itself, and the rest of theconcert fluctuated between the myriad of directions that became evident inthe first part of the first set. Many of the musicians moved about thespace, sometime forming groups to play together, sometimes just moving. Manyof the players wandered over to Taylor when he was at the piano and playedwith him. At times, members of some particular instrumental section wouldmove back to their seats and play a line from one of the compositions, andthe rest of the orchestra would follow and portions of one composition oranother would be played. Several times, when the orchestra would be in theirseats in the midst of a composition, one of the players would stand and"solo" with Taylor another kind of dynamic which I will talk about later.The end of the set settled down to Taylor soloing at the piano. The wholeperformance lasted over an hour and forty minutes.analysis of Tape Selection 2When asked what he wanted for the second set, Taylor said "Let's just pickup where we left off." The orchestra had become used to the spontaneousorganization and disorganization, the pull and flow between individualassertions and group identity, and the disjunction between the two weregetting stronger. A good illustration of this comes in Marco Eneidi's solo,which took place about thirty minutes into the set. During the solos most ofthe orchestra would remain quiet, and usually seated, while a single playerstood and played. A "solo" was really a dialogue between Taylor and theplayer, the percussionist, and occasionally guitarists. Soloing fulfilledthe player's desire to "play with Cecil," and became the ultimate assertionof individuality. The relationship between the individual and the groupbecomes more complicated at these points. Eneidi is also a powerful andaccomplished musician, who is very familiar with Taylor's music and hasperformed with him a number of times before.The portion I will talk about (the second selection on the tape also seeTape Selection 2 in the appendix) begins in section 7 of the compositionwhich begins with the violin chord G, F#, F, E. It is immediately apparentupon listening to the vocalizations of "having made gestures," that thegroup as a whole is using the material more as "anacrusis" rather than justa phrase to play throughthe whole orchestra has picked up the phrase, notjust the vocalists, and the variety of responses create a rich texture; a"plain" of activity where the individuality, the "strata" of each voice isdefinite yet supports a group identity. Taylor plays delicately against thismaterial, clearly set off from the group yet responsive to its shifts. Herewe can see how these scores, which had once seemed to alien to Taylor'smusical formulations, has, through the struggle between group and individualidentities, become a clear manifestation of his aesthetic.The tenors played slowly through their next line, as did the trombone, whowaited until the tenor's crescendo on E to accelerate the end his descendingline. Even in this short passage, the group's identity can be seen as moresolid that in the earlier selection; more spontaneous choices about how toperform the material are being made based on the playing of other sectionsand players. The orchestra functions as a single unit more effectively,moving smoothly instead of haltingly as before.The trumpets, altos, and bass clarinet entered next with their F#, E-flat, Dchord, but the differences are interesting. It is hard to tell, but Ibelieve it is the bass clarinet which actually began the passage. Thetrumpets and altos quickly followed, but in very different ways. Thetrumpets stuck closer to the score, playing together on the F# in a clearand mannered way four groups of six repetitions. The altos and clarinet, onE-flat and D respectively, merely used the notation as a suggestion, andplayed quick repetitions without regard for the number or grouping ofrepetitions. Taylor picked up on and augmented this energy, beginning in alow register, then moving quickly to a higher one in sync with the altos.The trumpets held their last note as a counter and support of the insistenceof the altos, but then dropped out. The altos, however, had assertedthemselves clearly as a section against the rest of the orchestra, and thenew assertion of the identity of this group unhinged the previous clarity oforchestral identity. The trombone and bass clarinet played their chord (D,D-flat, C), and some of the tenors played their chord (B-flat, A-flat, F,E), but it did not necessarily create coherence, rather it added to theincreasing energy and dissolution of the group identity. Next, Eneidi partedways with the repetitive altos and continued with their next line, the oneunderlined with the number (17). Free from the group, he freely interpretedthe line; the first phrase was transposed up a half-step, and he resolvedfrom B to B-flat rather than down a major seventh to C. He then playedanother phrase, one which was not written in the score, but was audiblybased on the line which preceded it. While several other horn players alsoparted from the material, Eneidi was really setting himself up for what wasto come. At the end of the phrase, there was a slight and momentary ebb inthe group sound, and here was where we got the first burst of soloisticmaterial which bears Eneidi's unique stamp. The end of this phrase waspunctuated by a cluster chord from Taylor, who seemed uniquely aware of theoccurring situation. By punctuating Eneidi's phrase, he was helping to drawhim out and distinguish him from the orchestra. Taylor continued in theupper register of the piano, but the orchestra was held in stasis for momentthe sound had not died down sufficiently for Eneidi to wholly emerge fromit, and his interjections remained one among many. The group as a whole wasunsure of who they were for a moment, just as Eneidi was unsure of his placeyet. For close to thirty seconds the identity of the orchestra hovered, notproceeding to section 9, although a few instrumental sections played throughsome of their lines, and not fully capitulating to the anarchic expressionof individuality, although interjections from several horn players suggestedthat direction. The coherence of the group had been fragmented by the shortbut strong assertion of Eneidi's unmistakable identity.In the last ten seconds of this episode, Eneidi began a varied repetition ofa phrase, something which I suspect he had developed out of the materialfrom the end of section 8, although by then it was beyond recognition. Heexpanded this material through those last ten seconds, as the groupattempted to reorient itself, so that when there was a break, a hesitationin which the percussion dropped out momentarily, Eneidi easily stepped intothe vacuum. I believe this is the place where he stood up to clearlydemonstrate his intention.The beginning of the Eneidi-Taylor dialogue was interesting. To begin with,there was a clear connection between him and Taylor, an obvious familiaritywith each other's playing. The exchange of information between the two wasrapid, and provides an excellent example of what in Unit Structures Taylordescribed as "the piano as catalyst feeding material to the soloists in allregisters." Additionally, the phrase that Eneidi used as the jumping offpoint of his solo is an excellent example of the function of the"anacrusis". The interaction between Eneidi and Taylor, then was the"Plain," where "patterns and possibility converge." The percussion andguitars supported this relationship. However, right at the beginning, wherethe majority of the orchestra had let Marco step forward, the string sectionbegan playing a phrase. They dropped out quickly, but one violinist (I amunable to identify the performer) remained playing incongruously over thetop of the Eneidi-Taylor interaction. To be fair, I must remark that therecording is not necessarily and accurate presentation of what the musiciansheard on stage, for most of the concert, and especially the during passagesof significant volume, the strings were inaudible. At this particularmoment, I am sure no one heard the violinist but him or herself.With the refocusing of the group onto Eneidi, the orchestral identity hadonce again been fragmented, but when the tenors entered with a spontaneousascending chromatic crescendo, the identity had solidified as supporters ofthe soloist: The tenor line and the brass stabs which accompany it wereclearly created to aid and amplify the dialogue between Eneidi and Taylor.There was also a participatory aspect to the accompaniment, but theinstrumental sections were functioning on the terms laid down by thepredominant individuals. Following the climax of the supporting orchestralassertions, Eneidi and Taylor continued, energized by the interjection ofthe group identity into their dialogue an inversion of the previousrelationship had now come about. Instead of the group identity takingprecedence and individualistic musical assertions interjecting themselvesand jostling the whole, here the identities of Taylor and Eneidi tookprecedence, and the orchestra reacted to them, actually recreating itsidentity based on its relationship to them.At the end of this passage, one of the trumpet players joined in, as anindividual, with a short blast from his horn. The other trumpets joined him,and the focus on the Eneidi-Taylor relationship shifted into a group dynamicof individual voices. As some of the tenor players and a guitar joined in,Eneidi dropped out, and within a few seconds, the whole thing dissolved. Inthis case, the additional entrance of several individuals into the musicdissipated the group focus instead of increased it, since the music had beenso concisely constructed along Eneidi and Taylor's interaction.As the short group improvisation dies out, Taylor continued along the lineshe established in the dialogue with Eneidi. As the tenors came in with theirline that begins C - A-flat - G -F, the orchestral identity that had been inoperation during sections 7 and the beginning of 8 returned, but Taylor'scontinued forceful individualistic assertions against the group dynamic ofthe orchestra forced the tenor phrase to come out. The trumpet, borrowingthe F from the chord at the end of the score section, punctuates the groupdynamic, reinforcing the identity of the orchestra as performers of thescore. When the chord swell that marks the end of score section 9 arrived,the entire orchestra had solidified in their identity. Eneidi, who momentsbefore had been defining the criteria for musical exchange, returnedcompletely to a functioning member of the group, indistinguishable from therest of his section and reinforcing the group dynamic. It is at this pointthat Taylor changed his playing to accommodate the direction the orchestrawas taking. The tenors repeated the phrase demarking the end of scoresection 9. Since the orchestral identity as performers of the score wasclear, this line was performed in a more delicate manner than before; itbecame a simple melodic passage rather than a forceful reassertion of groupidentity. The chord swell was also more delicate this time, and theorchestra moved easily into section 10.Taylor's music as an "actual society"As I hope I have demonstrated above, Cecil Taylor's music is not merely a"mythic representation" of society, but an actual society. It is a societystruggling to find its identity as both a "Unit" and also as a collection ofindividuals. The definition of an individual to the group is unfixed and inconstant flux. There are times where an individual voice is given room forunfettered expression, times where she or he lays outside the group playsasserts their individual voice against the group identity, and times wherethey willingly join in as an active participant of group identity. This, Ibelieve, is what Taylor meant when he said "The instrument a man uses isonly a tool with which he makes his comment on the structure of the music."In the context of Taylor's aesthetics, the instrument becomes the identity,the "strata" of the individual, and the way he or she defines that strata inrelationship to the entire "Plain" of group activity, the depth to which heor she has "mirrored the inner light," determines how they operate in thatenvironment. I used the example of Eneidi's solo because I thought it was aparticularly successful moment in the music, a riveting "Naked FireGesture." When I mentioned this to him after the performance, he said "Yeah,I knew I wanted to do it at some point." Eneidi knew how to operatesuccessfully in the environment Taylor had created; you can hear through thesecond example how he begins to set himself up, skillfully nudging andredirecting the orchestra until a space for him is created. He also exerts asimilar influence with his more subtle actions in the first example. He isable to do this because he is an accomplished musician in this idiom. He hasa distinctive and powerful soundin Taylor's terms he has found his "speechto oneself," discovered his individuality through his body-rhythms and isable to translate that into sound. And this individuality fits well withTaylor's. The dialogue between them is a manifestation of the "rhythmicalcelebration . . . the magical lifting of one's spirits to a state oftrance." The multileveled interaction between Eneidi, Taylor, and theorchestra, between the individuals and the group as a whole, is clearly whatTaylor describes as "the most heightened perception of one's self, but one'sself in a relationship to other forms of life." As I stated earlier, thesonic interplay between the individual and the collective is what createsthe spiritual aspects of the music, the "religious forces."individuality and multiple aestheticsHowever, not every musician in the orchestra was able to function asskillfully as Marco Eneidi. As I stated before, Eneidi has worked withTaylor several times before, is very familiar with this idiom, and has founda unique and powerful voice on his saxophone. He is very comfortable in thekind of environment which the performance created, just as he is comfortablein shifting his role in relationship to the group. There were a number ofcomplaints from other members of the orchestra, such as the inaudibility ofthe strings, and the seemingly incongruous playing of some of the musicians,such as the violinist at the beginning of Eneidi's solo. The whole "playingwith Cecil" aspect was problematic. Some of the interactions were quiteremarkable, while others, particularly those who were less familiar with thespecifics of Taylor's music, were described by some as "embarrassing." Inthose moments, the assertion of individuality seemed more of an emptygesture, even egotistical, and their playing and Taylor's seemed not like adialogue, but rather an incongruous projection of sonic disunity. Theintensity of Taylor's playing easily overshadowed the soloist, who seemedunable to react to Taylor's assertions. Again, an example of this is theviolinist at the beginning of Eneidi's solo; for a substantial period oftime, he or she does not follow the direction that the soloists or the restof the orchestra is taking, and is not asserting any kind of clearalternative directionrather he or she is just "noodling" on theirinstrument, absently playing, oblivious to his/her surroundings. It is quitea while before he/she begin the scratching sound with his/her bow, whichfits more comfortably with the other sounds being produced at that moment.From this perspective, one still has to wonder why he/she is playing at thisparticular moment at all. Yet many people have found this kind ofincongruous playing quite beautiful; Chris Brown described this particularmoment as "Ivesian." This points up an important element in the kind offreedom allowed in this performance: While any member could really doanything at any moment move anywhere, make any soundnot all activities wereequal, or had equal effect on the group. Nobody stopped the violinist fromplaying, but his or her ineffective assertion of individuality seemed to beignored by the orchestra in favor of the highly skillful, and notably muchlouder, voice of Eneidi. Yet an aesthetic acceptance of the incongruousaccepts that the violinist's playing may not be unsuccessful at all; in factthe more I have listened to this passage, the more I find it impossible tohold it to a single aesthetic standard. In a group of individuals, multipleaesthetics, and multiple definitions of success and failure according tothose aesthetics, coexist. What I find fascinating about this particularpassage is that it is a moment where these seemingly contradictoryaesthetics flourish without canceling each other out.gender and Taylor's formulationsWhile the violinist demonstrates an aesthetic multiplicity within theproceedings of the concert, there was also a deeper force at work on theways individuals related to the group, which was brought to my attention inan exchange just prior to our beginning the second set. The makeup of theorchestra was diverse, both racially and gender-wise, but men far outnumbered women. As we were assembling ourselves on the wings, waiting forthe second set to begin, I was standing next to tenor saxophonist JessicaJones when French Hornist Krys Bobrowski walked up to us. Jones commented toBobrowski "Oh good, I didn't want to be alone over here. All the other onesare over on the other side." She was referring to the fact that, except forher, Bobrowski, and pianist Dana Reason, all the other women were stringplayers or vocalists and entered from the other side of the stage. I said toher something along the lines of "Feeling outnumbered, huh?" and she replied"Oh yeah. Didn't you notice all the women? We were the ones standing uptaking all the solos." I should mention that her tone was ironic and funnyrather than bitter, (she has a great sense of humor) and the three of uslaughed. When I mentioned to Jones that she could take a "solo" if shewanted to, she replied "No. That's just not me."Her comment cast a new light on the proceedings for me. Jones is anaccomplished musician, runs her own band, and certainly has no problemasserting herself as a soloist. Yet, from the performances that I have seen,she usually works out the set list and solo order prior to the appearance onstage. Each musician is given time to express themselves individually withthe support of the group in a traditional fashion, even though the harmonicor rhythmic materials may not be typically "mainstream." The aspect of theperformance that she seemed to be saying that was "not her" was the wholedynamic of individuality expressed as a struggle against group identityherindividuality was not expressed that way. She also connected her concept ofindividualityone supported and expressed through a group, rather thanagainst it, as connected to her gender.From this perspective, Taylor had created a music that required themusicians to actively insert themselves into the process, even disrupt it,in order to assert their individuality. Even though there were moments wheneveryone was able to "blow," when the orchestra had become the "anarchicconvulsion of individual expression," even that dynamic operated on theassumption that individuality was best expressed by casting oneself into thefray. The structure of the music did not support one's individual identity,rather it was a constriction from which the individual was to break free,and in breaking free, the "self metamorphosising life's `act,'" the musicianwas supposed to come in contact with "religious forces." As Taylor himselfstated, emotive and individualistic expression is "aggressiveparticipation." What if that was not true for everyone? It seemed clear fromJones's comment that she believed the way the performance was beingconducted, and in particular the "playing with Cecil" aspect, was reallyjust a "guy thing"a male hierarchical struggle. Who she was as a woman wasat odds with the whole construct Taylor had presented. She was implying thatthe music was a form of male discourse, and therefore the basis of thatdiscourse, Taylor's assumptions and subsequent musical formulations, favoredthe way males are socialized over the way females are socialized.Pauline Oliveros and Cecil TaylorWith this in mind, it is interesting to compare the Taylor concert to aperformance some three weeks before of Pauline Oliveros's work at MillsCollege. Oliveros is an interesting comparison to Taylor; they are about thesame age (one year apart), and although they have taken quite differentaesthetic paths, they deal with similar issuesimprovisation, individual andgroup dynamics, spirituality, ritual, phsyicality, and poetic imagery.4Oliveros, too, has sought for an egalitarian music, which would reflect aswell as influence society. In her essay "And Don't Call Them `Lady'Composers," she states "Certainly, the greatest problems of society willnever be solved until an egalitarian atmosphere utilizing the total creativeenergies exists among all men and women."5 Where for Taylor equality isdefined along racial and ethnic lines, for Oliveros it is along genderlines. Taylor utilizes "African Methodology" which he sees as ultimatelyinclusive of all people, while Oliveros' approach is feminist, which shesees as promoting "creative interaction with everyone."6"Approaches and Departures"In Oliveros' concert at Mills, there was a premier of her piece "Approachesand DeparturesAppearances and Disappearances," a large group piece whichalso involved a certain amount of improvisation. The score was a text inwhich the instrumentalists were instructed:     Approach a pitch in as many ways as possible. What ever pitch is     selected stays the same for all options. Each performer selects     and plays independently. Each approach or departure should be     unique distinctly different in style and elements.7For this particular performance the instrumentalists were placed outside theperformance space, and their instruments amplified so as to be audible fromwithin the auditorium. There were included several "actors," all MillsCollege students, who used the stage as their "note," entering and exitingthe auditorium in their approaches and departures to the stage.Oliveros's conceptions of individualityThe structure Oliveros provided allowed for a great variety of individualexpression and interpretation, and the focus of the performance shiftedbetween the people involved in the realization as people entered and leftthe auditorium, both physically and audibly. There was no single momentwhere any performer really dominated the focus of the group; there were no"solos." As pianist Dana Reason described it, "It was about a group voice,about never having your voice above and beyond anyone else's." This implies,however, a specific kind of aesthetic within it is assumed that one'sindividual voice would feel natural, and with Oliveros, that aesthetic isone of a meditative tranquilityher own single approach and departure to thestage during the performance was described as moving "at a Wilsonian pace."8Oliveros describes music as "a multidimensional, dynamic process unfoldingas a relationship between an individual or a group of individuals, and soundvibrations."9 Yet that did not mean that everything everyone did, the wayeach individual's "voice" was expressed, was seen as an appropriatemanifestation of the "relationship". Apparently as skilled a musician asJulie Steinberg had some trouble during the rehearsal process, and wasperceived as playing "too many notes." This was resolved during rehearsaland was not a factor in performance, but it points out that there werestrict aesthetic limits on the nature of individual expression. Steinberg's'most natural interpretation of the score disrupted the "group voice," butthe aesthetic parameters of the "group voice" were the narrowly definedlimits of Oliveros' particular beliefs about the nature of spiritualitythrough` tranquility in individuality. While Oliveros herself states "I wishfor my work to be beneficial to myself and all who experience it,"10 herconceptions of the nature of "group voice" and the subordination ofindividuality to that aesthetic has caused one prominent feminist critic todescribe Oliveros's work as "fascist."11Taylor's and Oliveros' formulations as gendered discourseI do not by any means do justice to Oliveros' work with its brief mentionhere.12 I have brought it in because, if we are to consider the possibilitythat Taylor's music is a form of "male discourse," then we must look at whatwould then be its counterpart, and since Oliveros's music deals with some ofthe same issues that Taylor's does, it seems the appropriate place to lookfor a "female discourse." Have we found one in "Approaches and Departures?"The question really remains unanswered while Oliveros considers her musicfeminist, and straightforwardly addresses issues of gender and composition.In "A Conversation About Feminism And Music," Fred Maus mentionshierarchical struggle as "characteristically male," and Oliveros replies"That's the competitive mode. And competition is part of the humancondition, it has to play a role but not totally at the expense ofcooperation and collaboration."13 For Oliveros, then "cooperation andcollaboration" would be a form of female discourse, so from this perspective"Approaches and Departures" would seem to be just that. Yet, clearly not allwomen find themselves comfortable with the structure Oliveros created,whether it was playing "too many notes," or perceiving the whole"cooperative" dynamic as "fascist." On a more simple level, members of bothgenders have found themselves resonant with each structureStuart Dempsterwith Oliveros's, and Marilyn Crispell in Taylor's, for example.So is Taylor's music, then, a form of "male discourse?" The answer, to quoteJames Joyce, seems to be "Nes and Yo." If Taylor's music is constructed on"self-analysis" and the assertion of identity, then gender must play a rolein the that assertion, since it is an essential part of one's "self". Yet tostate that a musical formulation is purely a form of "male" or "female"discourse is to essentialize the relationship an individual has to theirgender. While disjunction between Jessica Jones's mode of discourse andTaylor's was seen by her as a disparity between their gendered selves; shestated clearly "That's just not me;" just the opposite seems true forMarilyn Crispell. In an interview with Graham Lock she describes talkingwith a colleague about her music prior to her explorations into jazz:     I told him, if I were going to improvise this is how I'd do it, and I     improvised atonal stuff the way I do now. I said, it's really crazy,     nobody would listen; he said, it's OK, you can do that, but I went no,     no, no. Then, later, I heard a Cecil Taylor record and it was YES, YES,     YES! Like a door opening.14Clearly, the musical discourse that Taylor has created resonates deeply withCrispell's "self"she had in fact developed a similar discourse herself priorto hearing Taylor's. When she found a connection with Taylor's music, shesaid that it was "Like being able to talk to someone who will finallyunderstand."15 Where Jones had felt a gulf between herself and Taylor'smusic, Crispell found a close affinity. For Jones the gulf was gendered, butCrispell does not see gender playing any kind of role. If we place equalweight on each one's perceptions, we can see that there are multipleunderstandings of the role of gender in Taylor's music. Just as multipleaesthetics coexist, so to do the perceptions of Taylor's music as gendereddiscourseit simultaneously is a form of "male discourse" and is not. AsJones perceives, Taylor's formulations seem to favor the way males aresocialized, but that does not mean that it is an essentially male construct.androgynous musicThe question, then, arises; Is Taylor's music an androgynous discourse? Inher Essay "Rags and Patches," Oliveros asks "I wonder what androgynousmusical form would be?" She then immediately relates the following:     Brahms' Y'all     I dreamed: A Brahms' symphony was to be played. Someone has     interpolated a jazz section. The orchestra plays. The jazz section     is quite smooth. As I suspected, the orchestra starts to break     down at the transition back to Brahms. The horn player completely     muffs his entrance. Only miserable puffs of air come out. The     conductor keeps flailing away but the string players become     increasingly confused and ragged. The conductor finally agrees to     stop and begin the transition again. I see the horn player putting     his horn away. I tell him to go back and try again. He rejoins the     orchestra. This time the solo comes through clearly. Then the horn     player breaks briefly into speech about his Southern United States     background. He continues playing and the solo has a decided     southern inflection.16This passage deals directly with musical manifestations of identity, and ithas interesting parallels to the Taylor performance. In addressing the issueof individual identity within a larger, established musical structure,Oliveros envisions a breakdown of the traditional European symphonicpractice. Interestingly, this breakdown is the result of the "jazzinterpolation"an of "intercultural infringement,"17 and this "infringement"acts as a catalyst for the exploration, assertion, and affirmation ofindividual and ethnic identity, manifest in the horn player's "decidedsouthern inflection." Like the "anti-jazz" musicians the sixties, whoseassertion of cultural identity was connected to the overturning of the"mainstream" conceptions of jazz, Oliveros sees the assertion of the hornplayers cultural and individual identity as a result of the overturning oftraditional conceptions about the functioning of a symphonic orchestra. Thisalso parallels the Taylor performance, where the undermining of theestablished orchestral identity brought about a reconfiguring of theindividual in relationship to the group. Where the "anti-jazz" artists sawthe establishment of individual identity as connected to race and culture,Oliveros additionally sees the connection to gender. The gender connection,however, is implicit rather than explicit: Oliveros herself states that"Brahms' Y'all" "is certainly not an androgynous form,"18 but she clearlyraises the idea that the realization individual identity, and its connectionto culture and gender, induces the breakdown of established modes of groupfunctioning.gender and music constructionsOliveros proposes that the mere act of questioning the role of gender inmusic undermines traditional conceptions of musical form and identity, and,amazingly, the scenario she envisions through the exploration of music asgendered discourse bears a striking resemblance to the Taylor performance.The Taylor performance, however, is really the inverse of Oliveros'sproposition: Through the undermining of the orchestra's identity, thedisruption of what the orchestra thought as the "form" of the music,conceptions of gender are brought into question. It should be noted, too,that the questions about the conceptions are not resolved either, as I hopeI have demonstrated above, seemingly contradictory understandings of thenature of the musical discourse existed without negating each other.Taylor and his musicTaylor's music is about the continuous flux and redefinition of theindividual in relationship to the group and to a superimposed musicalstructure. Taylor, operates on a definition of individual identity thatarises from the separation of oneself from the group, and within thatcontext, the individual is actually allowed absolute freedom. However, theutilization and exploration of that freedom, and even the gendered meaningof that freedom, may mean the alienation of those who do not share the samedefinition of individual expression.19Finally, what is most central to Taylor's music is Taylor himself. WhileOliveros's composition could have been performed successfully without herpresence, Taylor's certainly could not. It was he who both created and thencalled into question the group identity of the orchestra, and throughout theentire three hours of music, he constantly asserted his individuality, neveronce becoming "just a member of the orchestra." As Alvin Curran stated, "Itwas if you were all riding on his back, on his energy." In conversation withseveral of the performing musicians afterward, we all agreed that if we hadattempted this undertaking on our own, without Taylor, there without hisunique, powerful, and constant assertion of individuality to focus andchallenge the group, it would have seemed empty, pretentious and rathersilly. With him, however, it was at times transcendent.------------------------------------------------------------------------ Table of Contents      Part II           Conclusion------------------------------------------------------------------------footnotes1 Taylor described this word as "the name of an animal," but was unspecificas to what animal. Apparently it is a kind of South-American bird with longclaws.

In February,Taylor had been in the Bay Area for a week stint at Yoshi's Nitespot withhis quartet. While there, he formed an orchestra, just for rehearsalpurposes. Many of the members of the Jazz Festival orchestra participated inthose rehearsals; I had just observed them. Those rehearsals also consistedof playing through scores in the same manner described above. No performancewas ever intended or given. back3 From a description posted on the internet news group rec.music.bluenotethe day after the concert. back4 Oliveros has also been influenced by the Black Mountain poets.

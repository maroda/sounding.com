Just as at home with analog synthesizer electronics as with Infrastructure as Code, he finds joy in operating inherently chaotic complex systems. His expertise brings to bear a variegated background including data-center operations, storage hardware and distributed databases, IT security, site reliability, support services, observability systems, and techops leadership.

With degrees in music performance and composition, Matt has a passion for exploring the relationships between the artistic mind and operating distributed software architectures. This is reflected in his subjects for technology talks and his musical output, both of which seek out diverse ways to introspect and learn from our adaptive universe; most recently at SoCal Linux Expo, Sparklecon VII, RE:Deploy, Disney JETA, Music City Tech, and QCon NY.

Often performed on a combination of homemade instruments, DIY synthesizers, modular synth, vinyl records, fully analogue gear, small percussion, and sampled objects.

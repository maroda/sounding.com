at times i get overwhelmed by possibilities. the details drag me down, and i lose sight of the path. what causes this?

for instance, what music do i choose to write? do i use electro-acoustic elements, or do i stick to raw sound design? do these ways of working always produce the same results, even though i cannot hear them? do i limit myself by focusing on a working method that could easily shift into tunnelvision? why is it i think like this in the first place, because i hear opportunities of sound in what others are doing? because, hey, that&#8217;s a great sound, why didn&#8217;t i think of that?

we artists ask these questions. it takes a lot of self-confidence to go out there and sell yourself, but i&#8217;m still not sure what it is i do that makes my music what it is. i certainly try to find unique, DIY, individual ways of doing things, but i turn the corner and find someone building it better. some of the electronics instrument/effects building going on around the electronica community blows me away.

but what makes the music change? how does it develop? we&#8217;re moving into a world where musical styles &#8211; and listening &#8211; is more and more splayed, there are almost as many &#8220;genres&#8221; as there are individuals making music.

there is still something in the music that grabs the mind. it&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint exactly what &#8220;inspiration&#8221; or &#8220;genius&#8221; a particular piece contains, to different folks these mean completely different things. i usually can&#8217;t locate it in my own work, i certainly don&#8217;t know where it happens or how to identify it. regardless, it shows up.

so, in a very real way, it doesn&#8217;t matter what it is i do, or how i do it, just that it is me doing it, in the most genuine way i can.

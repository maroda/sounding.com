It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve sincerely blogged, as I&#8217;ve been somewhat obscured by computing lately. You&#8217;d think with all these computers around me, I&#8217;d be blogging all the time; but what I really want is less of them around me so that it feels like something more special than just another thing I do on the computer.

For example, this weekend was my birthday weekend (born in 1971, for those counting), and it felt very good going on &#8220;computer silence&#8221; for two days after the Friday night party. In fact, I didn&#8217;t do much of anything except plan my set for <a href="http://betalevel.com/2009/12/12/resonance-6/" target="_blank">next Saturday</a>, play Super Mario Bros Wii, and work through the pileup of recorded Showtime serials with my wife.

A good deal of people I know that make music on computers do so as a second life to their work day on them. Multitasking on computing problems at the same time as applying yourself creatively &#8211; and otherwise using software, interfacing with recording gear, attached hard drives, sound drivers, etc&#8230; all while you&#8217;re also concentrating on finishing that perl script for your job (if you&#8217;re lucky enough to be in an environment where your work computer can double as a creative tool), and of course keeping up with &#8220;the scene&#8221; in blog format or forums or twitter and social networks, not to mention keeping up with what feels like an exponentially growing volume of album releases &#8211; is not a very sustainable way to work.

Switching between brain processes like this often makes me feel fractured, like I am not quite in touch with the things that I identify with creating art. The myriad problems of computer technology are an infinitely complex layer of interaction which I can frankly do without. The irony of this is that before I went into a highly disciplined performance school, I had a &#8220;designed&#8221; undergrad major in music, focusing on Composition and Music Technology (a type of degree that&#8217;s now been heavily formalized in many universities, and is no longer rare at all). From that point forward, technology became a very important part of my musical description.

At some point, however, technology took over. It&#8217;s taken me many years to see in retrospect that what I was doing isn&#8217;t quite what I loved to do as a performer and an artist, and splitting my attention between things wasn&#8217;t helping my attempts at doing great things. As an extension of that, I believe my will to do original things was diminished by the layer of complexity and confusion brought on by an intervening computer operating system. Pretty soon, the issues I faced in my day-job became the same issues I faced in music making on the computer, and it wasn&#8217;t long that I couldn&#8217;t handle that union of cognitive space. I&#8217;ve now found myself not wanting to open a computer at all after I get home from work.

This may have a lot to do with circumstantial things: my day-job work environment isn&#8217;t great (bright fluorescent lamps, no privacy, high stress when on-call, poor management, general chaos), and I&#8217;ve had to sideline my musical activities in lieu of getting back up to speed on things I need for this job. When I get home, I don&#8217;t want to do much except unravel from the day, my motivation to create is low &#8211; not necessarily because I don&#8217;t want to make music, but because the enormous task of what to do with it after I&#8217;m done isn&#8217;t something I feel like dealing with any longer.

So I&#8217;m looking forward to this week in particular: in the coming days I&#8217;ll continue preparation and practicing for my set on 12/12, where I can just play music and not worry about computers in the process. I have some hurdles to overcome &#8211; fixing/patching the new modular so that at least \*some\* of it works, paring down the complexity of my instruments &#8211; so I will be forced to focus on music in the way I love: brainpower in the pursuit of creativity.

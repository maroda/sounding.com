Yesterday at 4:15PM (Pacific) I took a break from the chaos of networks and enjoyed a ceremonial oneness to honor the victims of Hiroshima in a gesture of world-wide harmony.

[hiro1615080508shima][1] starts about a minute before I rang in concert with many others across the globe for the <a href="http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/shimin/shimin/shikiten/shikiten-e.html" target="_blank">Hiroshimia Peace Memorial Ceremony</a>.

The recording was done in our garden walkway among our tropicals and succulents, you can hear the neighbor&#8217;s roof-top AC droning in the background, accompanied by our other neighbor&#8217;s dog. I love how the sound of the singing bowl (pictured here!) blends back into the surrounding drone.

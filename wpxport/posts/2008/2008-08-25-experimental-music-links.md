I&#8217;m usually happening upon all kinds of things while I&#8217;m across the Internets for work or play, and I&#8217;ll document the more interesting and pertinent ones here on sounding.com.

I keep my own list of interesting [Audio Hardware][1], as well as links to useful [Audio Software][2], a lot of which centers around open source or DIY.

Check out [Audio Culture][3] for general experimental audio society.

[Get Some][4] is my list of &#8220;obtaining&#8221; art and sound across the Internet, both pay-sites and places you can get free stuff.

Last but not least, I try to keep a tally of enticing online [Music Labels][5] where I&#8217;ve enjoyed releases and projects. Most of these are of the &#8220;netlabel&#8221; type and I&#8217;ve put some of my favorites at the top; the remaineder are those I tag with [delicious][6].

Enjoy the links and don&#8217;t hesitate to drop me a line to suggest something.

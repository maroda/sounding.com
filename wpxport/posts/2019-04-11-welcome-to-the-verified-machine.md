Imagine for a moment that you&#8217;re a software team, pushing new versions into production. You&#8217;re working on multiple pieces independently, so as you make changes automation pulls it all together in orderly [Continuous Integration][1]. At the right moment, your team&#8217;s work is pushed and [Continuous Delivery][2] does the job. Five deploys a day? No problem. Y&#8217;all have written, collaborated, tested, and published your glorious stuff. _Job well done!!!_

Just kidding, you&#8217;re not done. Does anyone write software that will suddenly just stop? Ok, maybe Y2K mitigation. But most of us in this industry want to see our stuff keep running into the unforeseeable future. That&#8217;s where **Continuous Verification** enters the picture. In operations, we&#8217;ve been given the ball to ensure the reliability of the software you write, but we want to be as invested in running it into the future as you are in writing it.

So, long story short (and trust me it&#8217;s long), that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now at a company called [**Verica**][3]. We are a **Continuous Verification** company. It&#8217;s an area closely aligned with Human Factors Engineering, Resilience Engineering, Safety, and Chaos Engineering. In fact, **_Chaos Engineering_** _is central to what we do_. We are here to help the enterprise get a leg up on Continuous Verification for the complex distributed systems they run. Tested in production, <g class="gr_ gr\_15 gr-alert gr\_gramm gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="15" data-gr-id="15">like</g> the glass says.

At **Verica**, I&#8217;m still doing ops. I am <g class="gr_ gr\_1445 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_disable\_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="1445" data-gr-id="1445">SRE</g>, I am Sr. Infrastructure Engineer, I am IT, I am NetEng, I am Purchasing, I am UAT. When we get some, I&#8217;ll be DataOps. Nevertheless, I&#8217;m beginning to traverse a lot more of the software stack than I ever have before (Golang and service meshes, reluctantly Python, you can rip my Zsh from my cold dead hands). I am excited to teach and speak and collaborate on all things **Chaos Engineering**, especially how it intersects with my musical proclivities. I will be speaking at [Texas Linux Fest][4] at the end of May about this very topic!

Most of all I&#8217;m excited to work with a stellar team. These are people I&#8217;ve changed up my life and taken great risks to work beside. Five years ago I discovered there was a close similarity between indeterminacy in distributed systems and the things I have studied in music. **Verica** is the next amalgamation of my love for musical improvisation and operating complex systems. It&#8217;s about time I wrote an opera, isn&#8217;t it?<figure class="wp-block-image">

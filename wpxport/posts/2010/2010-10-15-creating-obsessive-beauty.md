I happen to be a voracious reader. I would probably write more if I didn&#8217;t read so much. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is the tendency to obsess on a single writer&#8217;s work: someone or something will turn me on to a specific author, I&#8217;ll read one of his or her works, and immediately want to read everything they&#8217;ve ever done. On occasion I accomplish this, but sometimes the task is simply too great.

Currently I&#8217;m on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C_Clarke" target="_blank">Arthur C. Clarke (CBE)</a> trip, embarking with _**Childhood&#8217;s End**_ after recently finishing _**Rendezvous with Rama**_. To be honest these purchases were inspired by Clarke&#8217;s death in March of 2008, when I remembered how he changed my life while a freshman in high school.

It&#8217;s pretty interesting how we remember things, especially points in time that present themselves as an immediate recollection, almost painting-like in their clarity. When I first was assigned the task of reading the novel _**2001**_ as a freshman in the remote western mountains of North Carolina, there was some sort of stencil work done on my brain. I recall a very specific day in that classroom, noticing the green of a fresh blackboard, where I was so incredibly thrilled with this fantastic view into the Universe, that I immediately picked up **_2010_** and kept reading. Probably it was two or three years before I saw the accompanying films.

Then there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_gibson" target="_blank">William Gibson</a>. I read _**Neuromancer**_ and was completely hooked: I went through a barrage of Gibson novels right in a row, staying up late into the night when I should have been practicing, but instead being sucked into fantasies of Black Ice and the fast paced action of transient networks and cyberpunk, reality TV and a California civil war, popular meme-based advertising and terrorist plots &#8211; the language and ideas all resonate with me strongly.

But perhaps this was all an extension of my admitted affairs with the art and writings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs" target="_blank">William S. Burroughs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bowles" target="_blank">Paul Bowles</a> (his Wikipedia entry curiously devoid of photographs); authors whose catalog I have yet to extinguish but to whose prose I am drawn. Bowles holds a special place with me because I really got into his compositions for voice, singing many of them in recitals. My next multi-book adventure will be **_The Red Night Trilogy_**, parts of which I&#8217;ve read and even adapted to music.

I&#8217;m not sure what it is, but perhaps others have the same sort of drive I do, to explore authors and artists to whatever extent necessary. This leads me to wonder whether these types of minds will always exist, regardless of what we think &#8216;technology&#8217; is doing to our ability to appreciate non-technical forms of expression. Just because our mediums change doesn&#8217;t mean the human spirit has lost the ability to create beauty.

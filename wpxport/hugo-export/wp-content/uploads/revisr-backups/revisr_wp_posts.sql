As a visceral experience it\'s unmistakable, but the pathways to obtaining that level of immersion are not so clear.\r\n\r\nInspiration strikes at the most incredulous opportunity; sometimes it\'s like a pull, like gravitation towards a goal not seen, being drawn into a feeling that is indescribable beyond the need to create.\r\n\r\nWhat about when it\'s required? On-demand?\r\n\r\nLike an actor playing the same role week after week, or a jazz musician improvising over the same progressions night after night... the good ones - the ones really in touch with the craft - know where to look for passageways, or how to prepare themselves to accept the supernatural-like ability of the unconscious brain to know exactly how things go and exactly where in the most immediate and uncalculable ways.\r\n\r\nThat doorway is really the goal itself, the ego-freeing feeling of letting go and allowing what Nature designed to take its course. In a way artists do nothing but recite what they already know by understanding themselves as part of the entirety of life outside of themselves.','The Pull of the Unexplored',0,'','publish','open','open','','the-pull-of-the-unexplored','','','2008-07-19 13:08:08','2008-07-19 20:08:08','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=98',0,'post','',0),(99,2,'2008-07-26 12:26:07','2008-07-26 19:26:07','My favorite live downtempo band – <strong>T Spigot</strong> – is back in action this year, and to start it off they\'re offering the limited edition first pressing of <strong>Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Crime</strong>, <a href=\"http://tspigot.net/?p=11\" target=\"_blank\">available through paypal</a> for a measly $5, so go get it!\n\nThe bonus is that this version of the album includes the remix of <strong>dubnbud</strong> which they did for the 12\" release of <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/release/907346\" target=\"_blank\">Trolling for Olives</a>.\n\nThe version released on <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/release/171043\" target=\"_blank\">Water Music</a> didn\'t include it, probably for licensing/copyright reasons imposed by Water, but it\'s not exactly clear why.\n\nAt any rate, I\'m glad those guys are getting the CD version out there, because it\'s a great remix, and the entire album is one of my favorites of the genre.','T Spigot is rearing its burroughsian head once again',0,'','inherit','open','open','','85-autosave','','','2008-07-26 12:26:07','2008-07-26 19:26:07','',85,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=99',0,'revision','',0),(75,2,'2007-11-05 16:42:00','2007-11-05 23:42:00','<p />The CraqueCast for October/November 2007 features Matt Cooke-Davis (voice, sampled objects and electronics), Carol Genetti (voice) and Viv Corringham (voice) in a three-part free improvisation at The Nervous Center Festival of Electronic Music, Chicago 2002. <p /> Viv is a vocal experimenter from the UK who I met through Pauline Oliveros and the Deep Listening group, and has done some interesting work with \'walkabout\' listening and binaural recording. Carol is a Chicago-area vocalist who has worked with many other free improvisors and electronic musicians, we met through the improv scene there and were excited to do some collaboration for the Nervous Center. <p /> Three improvs were performed without any rehearsal for a small but exuberant audience in the basement of the Nervous Center. The three of us actually never rehearsed at all, what you hear is the first time any of us had performed together (we did do some pre-show planning the night before to go over technical details). <p /> The music is a fascinating romp. Most of the first two parts features Viv and Carol on voice, and I contributed vocal stuff in the third.

I\'m in this for the music, and the nights I put together are solely for celebrating the kind of music you cannot hear anywhere else, but that deserves every right to be heard because it\'s great and wonderful stuff. <p /> I don\'t mean for this to be a hurtful diatribe against the venue, the people, or the city; but they are things I feel need saying. <p /> Sometime soon I\'ll compile a list of some of my favorite Loungeometry music, but in the mean time you can hear archived sets on the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://craque.net/craque.xml\">CraqueCast</a>.<p /><b>Tags</b>: <a href=\"https://sounding.com/bin/view/Sounding/BlogArchive?mode=tag&amp;search=society, shows, dj\" rel=\"tag\">society, shows, dj</a>',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=80',0,'post','',0),(81,2,'2008-01-20 23:09:00','2008-01-21 06:09:00','Behold the appalling beautiful world of <strong>Density Operator</strong> now available on <a href=\"http://www.stadtgruenlabel.net/index.php?locator=releases&amp;id=41\" target=\"_blank\">Stadtgruen</a>.\r\n\r\n\"The title is program: everything in this world seems to be under pressure in order to extract the highest concentration of agility.

Below these fractured mantle pieces is a thick world of geology: elemental chemical reactions, intense temperature changes, varying strata of materials. There may be violent upheaval or capitulation of forces, or just still and silent veins of metal. If we could travel as a massless beings through the earth to the antipodal, each layer of Hell opens not a Dantean dream, but a surreal tour of random pockets describing the origin of the solar system.\r\n\r\n<em>Tekuchesti</em> represents \"fluidity\" in physics, describing instability or fluid states. The piece consists of constructions mostly taken from free electro-acoustic improvisations, first recorded to create large elemental plates of experience, and secondly edited and combined into subdivisions of space. There were no structural or material limitations placed on the recording or editing of the improvisations, they simply happened.\r\n\r\nJust as there are myriad structures and surprise events, there are the lack of these events, represented by the isochrons; dating scatterplots of history, constructions made from the lack of material to represent that which has passed on. The sonic architecture of each isochron in this piece is taken from relationships found in the five Platonic (or \"perfect\") solids, found everywhere in nature, above and below the crust.\r\n\r\nThis piece is meant to be played in random order, where the slices intermingle anew each time to create an emergent form. Playing it in order will reveal some of the underlying structure, and is a perfectly acceptable way of listening - the shapes of the plates become much more clear, but it is an altogether different listening experience. Improvisers are encouraged to play along as well, but if done in a live context, it must be played on shuffle, as this will give the improvisers less expectation of what sounds will appear.\r\n\r\nThe work also ties in an immediate tectonic experience: I live only 10 miles from the epicenter of the 5.4 magnitude earthquake which hit the LA area on July 29, just shortly before the album was finalized. It also represents the \"solid ground\" - both as shared vision and literal Earth - between me and the constanta-label.ru headquarters in Perm, Russia.</blockquote>\r\nConstanta on the web: http://constanta-label.ru\r\nConstanta on myspace: http://www.myspace.com/constantalabel','Craque: \"Tekuchesti\" out now on Constanta',0,'','publish','open','open','','craque-tekuchesti-out-now-on-the-constanta-netlabel','','','2008-10-03 12:02:01','2008-10-03 19:02:01','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=164',0,'post','',0),(165,2,'2008-10-03 10:50:17','2008-10-03 17:50:17','I\'m very happy to announce the release of a project I did this summer called <em>Tekuchesti</em>, (a transliteration of<em> текучести</em>, which is a Russian word meaning \"fluidity\"), a piece in shuffle time for listeners and improvisers.\n\nDownload the entire work, and remember to listen on shuffle!

I was attracted to the surrealism in the description of <strong><em>Baby Pictures of Famous Dictators</em></strong> and almost immediately had an image of what the film would be like.\n\nNot having read this novel yet, the source of my inspiration was the description itself:\n<blockquote>\"Baby Pictures Of Famous Dictators\" - Year of the Tucks Medicated Pad. Poor Yorick Entertainment Unlimited. Documentary or uncredited cast w/ narrator P.A. Heaven; 16 mm; 45 minutes; black and white; sound. Children and adolescents play a nearly incomprehnsible nuclear strategy game with tennis equipment against a real or holographic (?) backdrop of sabotaged ATHSCME 1900 atmospheric displacement towers exploding and toppling during the New New England Chemical Emergency of Y.W. CELLULOID (UNRELEASED)</blockquote>\nI took 45 minutes as my guiding point and imagined the film was a tableau, a \"moving still life\" of sorts. It\'s a 45 minute long game, a slow motion still life of a disaster reflected in the childsplay of fooling around with physics.\n\nWe see a setting that never changes, of innocent children (we assume the same as in the pictures referenced by the title) against a backdrop that is ever changing, sharing an appetite for control. They become the embodiment of the Famous Dictators, playing games, like children, with adult toys of power and war.\n\nA chemical emergency could imply this is related to nuclear power or physics. Are the children playing a game that caused the emergency? Are they blissfully unaware? Or are they working to solve the problem by a series of complex nuclear games? It\'s unclear if we will ever know.\n\nThe soundtrack is not a reflection of the action seen onscreen, but rather the literal voice of each proper name. As their structures compost, weaving as they play the game, new forms are illuminated.\n\nThese nine names were used to drive various parameters specific to each person\'s voice, guiding things like frequency, filters, delay effects and envelope (in each case, the longest, most familiar version of the English proper name was used):\n<ul>\n	<li>Adolf Hitler</li>\n	<li>Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin</li>\n	<li>Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini</li>\n	<li>Mao Zedong</li>\n	<li>Ho Chi Minh</li>\n	<li>Francisco Franco Bahamonde</li>\n	<li>Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz</li>\n	<li>Saddam Hussein</li>\n	<li>Tojo Hideki</li>\n</ul>\nThe analysis of the text file containing the names was done with <a href=\"http://www.perl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">perl</a>, which wrote out various <a href=\"http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">ChucK</a> files.

My problem, however, is that I am way too interested in multiple facets of music releases to pay attention in any style for very long. I seek out what really turns my ear, the gems of sound that are unique statements of purpose or individuality. Since I desire great pieces of listening, I spend time searching for it, which means I listen to a lot of not so great things too, and that goes double for netlabels. Needless to say I associate my music activities in a very close circle, I do very fringe stuff, really of a limited appeal on the grand scheme of things. My listening is only very more or less fringey than that, but I thought, well hell why not, I listen to all this music I may as well review it (however briefly) and share my twisted sense of what\'s good music to the dozen people who bother to look at my blog (and if you do, i thank you for at least being interested). And yes you guessed it, listening to all 24 albums shown here will take you almost exactly 24 hours. So enjoy!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/volumeobjects.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-225 alignleft\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Volume Objects\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/volumeobjects-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Autistici</strong> : <em>Volume Objects</em> : 12K\r\nSubtle explorations of sound relationships and rhythm, blending elements of recognizable instruments and easy going synth gestures with elegantly placed electro-acoustic underpinning. I imagine a conductor with the most supreme control of his sonic elements, swirling around in a glaze.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/favoriteplaces.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-226 alignright\" title=\"Favorite Places\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/favoriteplaces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Favorite Places</em> : <strong>Audiobulb</strong>\r\nA wonderful concept! Recordings and compositions from favorite places of the included artists, a very personal record, wide in breadth. Equal parts phonography and arranged constructions, in some cases I feel like I become part of that place. Eerie and magical.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sool.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-227\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"sool\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sool-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Ellen Allien</strong> : <em>Sool</em> : BPitch Control\r\nCount this one as a surprise indeed. I\'m used to a heavier hand when it comes to bpitch and this gal, so a well-crafted minimal techno album with some actual musical interest was the last thing I expected. The tunes are understated but driven in a way that especially matches the style, engaging but never harsh.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/middlemarch.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-228\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Middlemarch\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/middlemarch-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>He Can Jog</strong> : <em>Middlemarch</em> : Audiobulb\r\nThere is a finesse with which HCJ can blend noise and consonance that\'s infectious and maybe just a little frightening. He shares the same ranks with other electro-acoustic artists here that like a tasty blend of percussion with their textures, and I think he does it quite excellently with a sparing amount of sugar on top.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lightindustry.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-229\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Light Industry\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lightindustry-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\" /></a><strong>Ilkae</strong> : <em>Light Industry</em> : Eerik Inpuj Sound\r\nJust one person now, Ilkae has released one heck of an outing that mixes pure abstract expressionism with a smattering of melodies and structures that stick in my ear until I\'m humming it when I wake up in the morning. LSK and Magnesium are both choice cuts.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cyclothymia.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-230\" title=\"Cyclothymia\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cyclothymia-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Proswell</strong> : <em>Cyclothymia</em> : Eerik Inpuj Sound\r\nOver 65 tracks between 0 and 6 minutes. Inspired miniatures, fully rounded songs, brief brightly colored sketchings; some of the best work he\'s done to date. A lot of the songs appeared in a podcast over the course of the year, but it is great to have a full collection of them under one cover. Randomized listening highly recommended.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/format.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-233\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"format\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/format-299x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"107\" height=\"108\" /></a>Various : <em>Format</em> : <strong>Fällt</strong>\r\nAlong the same lines of the miniatures Proswell and Ilkae (and myself, inspired by thus) have done, one of my favorite pieces of this comp is Tonne\'s \"Paper/Pixels\": a corrugated 71 tracks at only 7 seconds or less apiece, from tiny little beats looped once to bursts of noise or nearly silence. Taylor Deupree and FourColor also stand out on this one, wonderful collection!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-234\" title=\"luminarium\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Tape</strong> : <em>Luminarium</em> : Häpna\r\nPolished construction and structure, with a perfect balance of acoustic and electric. These guys know how to make an ensemble be an ensemble and not just a band trying to add computers. The compositional acumen stands on its own in a collection of poignant, soft melodies and instrumentation that I haven\'t quite heard before in this context. Looking forward to more from this gang.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-235\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"magnetismthatelectricity\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Magnetism, That Electricity...</em> : <strong>HighPoint LowLife</strong>\r\nAll the HPLL artists shine on this comp, but I especially like the dark analog synth contributions of Fink Industries (check out the remixes of his tracks too) and the contrasting bubbly lift of The Marcia Blaine School for Girls. There is such a wide range of styles on here that it\'s difficult to describe, but it\'s fantastic listening with a tropical forest of influences and approaches.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-236\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"sworn\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Anders Ilar</strong> : <em>Sworn</em> : Level\r\nMoving to the 4x4 side of things, a flawlessly constructed set of tracks. Haunting would be a good word to describe the melodies and dub feel, but really it\'s just good smooth techno with a nice groove and peppered funky.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/terminal.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-237\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"terminal\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/terminal-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Terminal</em> : <strong>Narita</strong>\r\nThis does have an Ilar track on it that could have easily been on <em>Sworn</em>, but it features so many other great techno folks that it deserves a place on my list for sure. Not to mention it\'s supposedly the very last release from the depths of Merck/Narita. I like working in the garden with this one thumping out to me... Senior Frio, Blamstrain, Arctic Hospital, Brothomstates, Yard, Adam Johnson... grow plants grow!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/deathofatypographer.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-239\" title=\"deathofatypographer\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/deathofatypographer-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Byetone</strong> : <em>Death of a Typographer</em> : Raster-Noton\r\nI was pleasantly surprised when hearing this mechanical beast roar in my studio. Pure waveforms have become the subject of extreme grooves and almost downright hooky harmonic form. It\'s good to hear these guys move on from their surgical masturbation to something more substantial. I\'m all for delicate glass soundscapes but you can only have so many before the personality is literally worn thin.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/oleva.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-240\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"oleva\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/oleva-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Ø</strong> : <em>Oleva</em> : Sähkö\r\nThere are times when blocks of sound and imagined landscapes go hand in hand.

My problem, however, is that I am way too interested in multiple facets of music releases to pay attention in any style for very long. I seek out what really turns my ear, the gems of sound that are unique statements of purpose or individuality. Since I desire great pieces of listening, I spend time searching for it, which means I listen to a lot of not so great things too, and that goes double for netlabels. Needless to say I associate my music activities in a very close circle, I do very fringe stuff, really of a limited appeal on the grand scheme of things. My listening is only very more or less fringey than that, but I thought, well hell why not, I listen to all this music I may as well review it (however briefly) and share my twisted sense of what\'s good music to the dozen people who bother to look at my blog (and if you do, i thank you for at least being interested). And yes you guessed it, listening to all 24 albums shown here will take you almost exactly 24 hours. So enjoy!\n\n<strong>Autistici</strong> : <em>Volume Objects</em> : 12K\nSubtle explorations of sound relationships and rhythm, blending elements of recognizable instruments and easy going synth gestures with elegantly placed electro-acoustic underpinning. I imagine a conductor with the most supreme control of his sonic elements, swirling around in a glaze.\n\nVarious : <em>Favorite Places</em> : <strong>Audiobulb</strong>\nA wonderful concept! Recordings and compositions from favorite places of the included artists, a very personal record, wide in breadth. Equal parts phonography and arranged constructions, in some cases I feel like I become part of that place. Eerie and magical.\n\n<strong>Ellen Allien</strong> : <em>Sool</em> : BPitch Control\nCount this one as a surprise indeed. I\'m used to a heavier hand when it comes to bpitch and this gal, so a well-crafted minimal techno album with some actual musical interest was the last thing I expected. The tunes are understated but driven in a way that especially matches the style, engaging but never harsh.\n\n<strong>He Can Jog</strong> : <em>Middlemarch</em> : Audiobulb\nThere is a finesse with which HCJ can blend noise and consonance that\'s infectious and maybe just a little frightening. He shares the same ranks with other electro-acoustic artists here that like a tasty blend of percussion with their textures, and I think he does it quite excellently with a sparing amount of sugar on top.\n\n<strong>Ilkae</strong> : <em>Light Industry</em> : Eerik Inpuj Sound\nJust one person now, Ilkae has released one heck of an outing that mixes pure abstract expressionism with a smattering of melodies and structures that stick in my ear until I\'m humming it when I wake up in the morning. LSK and Magnesium are both choice cuts.\n\n<strong>Proswell</strong> : <em>Cyclothymia</em> : Eerik Inpuj Sound\nOver 65 tracks between 0 and 6 minutes. Inspired miniatures, fully rounded songs, brief brightly colored sketchings; some of the best work he\'s done to date. A lot of the songs appeared in a podcast over the course of the year, but it is great to have a full collection of them under one cover. Randomized listening highly recommended.\n\nVarious : <em>Format</em> : <strong>Fällt</strong>\nAlong the same lines of the miniatures Proswell and Ilkae (and myself, inspired by thus) have done, one of my favorite pieces of this comp is Tonne\'s \"Paper/Pixels\": a corrugated 71 tracks at only 7 seconds or less apiece, from tiny little beats looped once to bursts of noise or nearly silence. Taylor Deupree and FourColor also stand out on this one, wonderful collection!\n\n<strong>Tape</strong> : <em>Luminarium</em> : Häpna\nPolished construction and structure, with a perfect balance of acoustic and electric. These guys know how to make an ensemble be an ensemble and not just a band trying to add computers. The compositional acumen stands on its own in a collection of poignant, soft melodies and instrumentation that I haven\'t quite heard before in this context. Looking forward to more from this gang.\n\nVarious : <em>Magnetism, That Electricity...</em> : <strong>HighPoint LowLife</strong>\nAll the HPLL artists shine on this comp, but I especially like the dark analog synth contributions of Fink Industries (check out the remixes of his tracks too) and the contrasting bubbly lift of The Marcia Blaine School for Girls. There is such a wide range of styles on here that it\'s difficult to describe, but it\'s fantastic listening with a tropical forest of influences and approaches.\n\n<strong>Anders Ilar</strong> : <em>Sworn</em> : Level\nMoving to the 4x4 side of things, a flawlessly constructed set of tracks. Haunting would be a good word to describe the melodies and dub feel, but really it\'s just good smooth techno with a nice groove and peppered funky.\n\nVarious : <em>Terminal</em> : <strong>Narita</strong>\nThis does have an Ilar track on it that could have easily been on <em>Sworn</em>, but it features so many other great techno folks that it deserves a place on my list for sure. Not to mention it\'s supposedly the very last release from the depths of Merck/Narita. I like working in the garden with this one thumping out to me... Senior Frio, Blamstrain, Arctic Hospital, Brothomstates, Yard, Adam Johnson... grow plants grow!\n\n<strong>Byetone</strong> : <em>Death of a Typographer</em> : Raster-Noton\nI was pleasantly surprised when hearing this mechanical beast roar in my studio. Pure waveforms have become the subject of extreme grooves and almost downright hooky harmonic form. It\'s good to hear these guys move on from their surgical masturbation to something more substantial. I\'m all for delicate glass soundscapes but you can only have so many before the personality is literally worn thin.\n\n<strong>Ø</strong> : <em>Oleva</em> : Sähkö\nThere are times when blocks of sound and imagined landscapes go hand in hand. Just wonderfully alien and funky, stuff that makes your torso vibrate. Contains probably my favorite Pink Floyd cover ever; \"set the controls for the heart of the sun\" is perfect for brooding, dark-sparked audio.\n\nVarious : <em>Round Black Ghosts</em> : <strong>~scape</strong>\nI have to be honest, the output of this label has been questionable for the past few years, so it\'s good to hear this collection of experimentally tinged and dub-inspired dance grooves. Pole stands out of course, but 2562\'s \"Channel Two\" is probably my favorite.\n\n<strong>Juxta Phona &amp; OffTheSky</strong> : <em>!Escape Kit!</em> : Somnia\nUnquestionably the best new thing to come out of Evan Bluetech\'s new label. There is a hefty amount of experimentalism balanced out by beats, supported by (of course) a dub atmosphere, but further punctuated by a free jazz influence. Right up my alley, the vibraphone work is especially sublime. Somnia has turned out not to be a hyper-ambient thing like I feared, I\'m encouraged by the diversity of their CD\'s so far, and I love the beautiful packaging. Some of the only CDs I still buy, in fact.\n\n<strong>Brassica</strong> : <em>Microvictories</em> : Tartaruga\nAnother CD I had to buy because of the packaging, Calika recommended this album, calling it the best thing he had heard this year. As you can see I had a hard enough time narrowing things down to 24, so naming something numero uno isn\'t really my bag. However, I absolutely love the approach in this music. The same sort of collage-inspired acousmatic blending but with his own unique voice in a way that draws you into what\'s happening, and before you know it the album is over. And you get an oragami turtle with it! How awesome is that?\n\n<strong>D\'incise</strong> : <em>Les Restes du Festin</em> : Test Tube\nThis music reminds me the most of music school, I\'m not sure why. I think there is a connection with composers I studied that made a subliminal crossing to the work of d\'incise, but it could be the natural fluidity of the sound that works the most like a classical string quartet. I enjoy the fact that he uses less beats but arrives at the same atmosphere as earlier albums, carrying the listener along in what seems to be a storyline that never quite reveals itself.\n\n<strong>Fennesz</strong> : <em>Black Sea</em> : Touch\nFinally a Fennesz I can listen to all the way through without thinking it was on repeat the whole time. There is a lot more diversity in this record than any other, showing a real willingness to develop beyond the distorted-guitar-drone rut. I\'ve heard other die-hard Fennesz fans poo-poo this album, so it\'s interesting I think it\'s more mature than others. It\'s similar to how I think Murcof has grown, I\'m looking forward to what he\'s doing this year as well.\n\n<strong>Portishead</strong> : <em>Third</em> : Universal Island\nUniquely spectacular in their own way. It thrills me to no end that they employed their own studio recordings for this instead of the sample-based thing. Not that Dummy isn\'t the best triphop album ever, but they\'ve shown here that the band is really a group with something musical to say, not just push out badass basslines. Beth Gibbons has the most sultry voice ever, I cannot get enough of her inflection.\n\n<strong>Autechre</strong> : <em>Quaristice</em> : Warp\nSay what you will, the \"bonus\" CD for this album is so much better than the \"original version\" of the tracks. I think it\'s an amazing escape into surreal dancescapes and fractured electro, it\'s very mature and non-egotistic Booth\'n\'Brown just having fun and making some cool ass tunes. The reason people hate these guys for doing things like this is because they won\'t drop their expectations and just listen to the sound, and want it all to be like 1997 again.\n\n<strong>Flying Lotus</strong> : <em>Los Angeles</em> : Warp\nWhat I had always wished Prefuse73 was. And now I no longer have to! Artists who pull out just the right elements of hip hop that I like and pull it threadbare through an electronics sieve are A-OK in my book. It also helps this is not an hour of the same approach to beatcutting and voice splicing over and over again. I concede people are into that. I\'m not.\n\n<strong>Deadbeat</strong> : <em>Roots and Wire</em> : Wagon Repair\nIf you couldn\'t tell there is a definitely swing towards the reggae side of things in my library. Swelling basslines and rim snaps, echoes filtering every which way, the sort of limping I love most. What starts off as a minimalistic break-beaty sort of dancehall album assuredly melts into easy rolling dubhouse. I think it\'s the most well put together Deadbeat of any.\n\n<strong>Letna</strong> : <em>Tisza Meets Dunav</em> : Zymogen\nAh some of the most beautiful drones of the year. Very popular this style, it\'s only really successful when done with detail and depth. This album imagines me drifting between layers of impossibly smokey silk.\n\n<strong>Jimmy Behan</strong> : <em>In the Sudden Distance</em> : Zymogen\nA sort of minimal chamberwork, with an unevenness and simplicity that mingles the sound as if it belonged there the whole time.

The reason people hate these guys for doing things like this is because they won\'t drop their expectations and just listen to the sound, and want it all to be like 1997 again.\n\n<strong>Flying Lotus</strong> : <em>Los Angeles</em> : Warp\nWhat I had always wished Prefuse73 was. And now I no longer have to! Artists who pull out just the right elements of hip hop that I like and pull it threadbare through an electronics sieve are A-OK in my book. It also helps this is not an hour of the same approach to beatcutting and voice splicing over and over again. I concede people are into that. I\'m not.\n\n<strong>Deadbeat</strong> : <em>Roots and Wire</em> : Wagon Repair\nIf you couldn\'t tell there is a definitely swing towards the reggae side of things in my library. Swelling basslines and rim snaps, echoes filtering every which way, the sort of limping I love most. What starts off as a minimalistic break-beaty sort of dancehall album assuredly melts into easy rolling dubhouse. I think it\'s the most well put together Deadbeat of any.\n\n<strong>Letna</strong> : <em>Tisza Meets Dunav</em> : Zymogen\nAh some of the most beautiful drones of the year. Very popular this style, it\'s only really successful when done with detail and depth. This album imagines me drifting between layers of impossibly smokey silk.\n\n<strong>Jimmy Behan</strong> : <em>In the Sudden Distance</em> : Zymogen\nA sort of minimal chamberwork, with an unevenness and simplicity that mingles the sound as if it belonged there the whole time. Definitely ambient, but more personal than a pure drone album, with smaller spaces and more intricacy.\n\nSome others worth mentioning:\n\nImplex Grace : <em>Through Luminescent Passages (I &amp; II)</em>\nHRSTA : <em>Ghosts Will Come Kiss Our Eyes</em>\nHol Baumann : <em>Human</em>\nFly Pan Am : <em>Ceux Qui Inventent N\'Ont Jamis Vecu</em>\nEvan Marc + Steve Hillage : <em>Dreamtime Submersible</em>\nElectricwest : <em>Divine de Vice</em>\nAlva Noto : <em>UNITXT</em>\nWilder Gonzales Agreda : <em>Se Tu Propio Totem</em>\nTrivium : <em>Shogun</em>\nTanox : <em>Astronomia de Balcon</em>\nSecret Chiefs 3 : <em>Xaphan: Book of Angels Vol. 9</em>\nop.cit. : <em>Under the Sweel</em>\nnaw : <em>vague terrain 10: digital dub</em>\nMotionfield : <em>Optical Flow</em>\nModel 500 : <em>Starlight remixes</em>\nLone : <em>Lemurian</em>\nVarious : <em>Dame Citrus</em>','My best 24 hours of music in 2008',0,'','inherit','open','open','','220-revision-5','','','2009-01-05 22:13:59','2009-01-06 05:13:59','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=232',0,'revision','',0),(233,2,'2009-01-05 22:41:09','2009-01-06 05:41:09','','format',0,'','inherit','open','open','','format-2','','','2009-01-05 22:41:09','2009-01-06 05:41:09','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/format.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(234,2,'2009-01-05 22:42:02','2009-01-06 05:42:02','','luminarium',0,'','inherit','open','open','','luminarium','','','2009-01-05 22:42:02','2009-01-06 05:42:02','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(235,2,'2009-01-05 22:42:32','2009-01-06 05:42:32','','magnetismthatelectricity',0,'','inherit','open','open','','magnetismthatelectricity','','','2009-01-05 22:42:32','2009-01-06 05:42:32','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(236,2,'2009-01-05 22:43:16','2009-01-06 05:43:16','','sworn',0,'','inherit','open','open','','sworn','','','2009-01-05 22:43:16','2009-01-06 05:43:16','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(237,2,'2009-01-05 22:44:31','2009-01-06 05:44:31','','terminal',0,'','inherit','open','open','','terminal','','','2009-01-05 22:44:31','2009-01-06 05:44:31','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/terminal.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(238,2,'2009-01-05 22:43:56','2009-01-06 05:43:56','I like to make myself feel as if I\'m somehow close to the elusive community of electronic music.

I imagine a conductor with the most supreme control of his sonic elements, swirling around in a glaze.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/favoriteplaces.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-226 alignright\" title=\"Favorite Places\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/favoriteplaces-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Favorite Places</em> : <strong>Audiobulb</strong>\nA wonderful concept! Recordings and compositions from favorite places of the included artists, a very personal record, wide in breadth. Equal parts phonography and arranged constructions, in some cases I feel like I become part of that place. Eerie and magical.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sool.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-227\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"sool\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sool-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Ellen Allien</strong> : <em>Sool</em> : BPitch Control\nCount this one as a surprise indeed. I\'m used to a heavier hand when it comes to bpitch and this gal, so a well-crafted minimal techno album with some actual musical interest was the last thing I expected. The tunes are understated but driven in a way that especially matches the style, engaging but never harsh.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/middlemarch.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-228\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Middlemarch\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/middlemarch-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>He Can Jog</strong> : <em>Middlemarch</em> : Audiobulb\nThere is a finesse with which HCJ can blend noise and consonance that\'s infectious and maybe just a little frightening. He shares the same ranks with other electro-acoustic artists here that like a tasty blend of percussion with their textures, and I think he does it quite excellently with a sparing amount of sugar on top.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lightindustry.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-229\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Light Industry\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lightindustry-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"72\" height=\"72\" /></a><strong>Ilkae</strong> : <em>Light Industry</em> : Eerik Inpuj Sound\nJust one person now, Ilkae has released one heck of an outing that mixes pure abstract expressionism with a smattering of melodies and structures that stick in my ear until I\'m humming it when I wake up in the morning. LSK and Magnesium are both choice cuts.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cyclothymia.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-230\" title=\"Cyclothymia\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cyclothymia-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Proswell</strong> : <em>Cyclothymia</em> : Eerik Inpuj Sound\nOver 65 tracks between 0 and 6 minutes. Inspired miniatures, fully rounded songs, brief brightly colored sketchings; some of the best work he\'s done to date. A lot of the songs appeared in a podcast over the course of the year, but it is great to have a full collection of them under one cover. Randomized listening highly recommended.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/format.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-233\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"format\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/format-299x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"107\" height=\"108\" /></a>Various : <em>Format</em> : <strong>Fällt</strong>\nAlong the same lines of the miniatures Proswell and Ilkae (and myself, inspired by thus) have done, one of my favorite pieces of this comp is Tonne\'s \"Paper/Pixels\": a corrugated 71 tracks at only 7 seconds or less apiece, from tiny little beats looped once to bursts of noise or nearly silence. Taylor Deupree and FourColor also stand out on this one, wonderful collection!\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-234\" title=\"luminarium\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Tape</strong> : <em>Luminarium</em> : Häpna\nPolished construction and structure, with a perfect balance of acoustic and electric. These guys know how to make an ensemble be an ensemble and not just a band trying to add computers. The compositional acumen stands on its own in a collection of poignant, soft melodies and instrumentation that I haven\'t quite heard before in this context. Looking forward to more from this gang.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-235\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"magnetismthatelectricity\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Magnetism, That Electricity...</em> : <strong>HighPoint LowLife</strong>\nAll the HPLL artists shine on this comp, but I especially like the dark analog synth contributions of Fink Industries (check out the remixes of his tracks too) and the contrasting bubbly lift of The Marcia Blaine School for Girls. There is such a wide range of styles on here that it\'s difficult to describe, but it\'s fantastic listening with a tropical forest of influences and approaches.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-236\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"sworn\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Anders Ilar</strong> : <em>Sworn</em> : Level\nMoving to the 4x4 side of things, a flawlessly constructed set of tracks. Haunting would be a good word to describe the melodies and dub feel, but really it\'s just good smooth techno with a nice groove and peppered funky.\n\nVarious : <em>Terminal</em> : <strong>Narita</strong>\nThis does have an Ilar track on it that could have easily been on <em>Sworn</em>, but it features so many other great techno folks that it deserves a place on my list for sure. Not to mention it\'s supposedly the very last release from the depths of Merck/Narita. I like working in the garden with this one thumping out to me... Senior Frio, Blamstrain, Arctic Hospital, Brothomstates, Yard, Adam Johnson... grow plants grow!\n\n<strong>Byetone</strong> : <em>Death of a Typographer</em> : Raster-Noton\nI was pleasantly surprised when hearing this mechanical beast roar in my studio. Pure waveforms have become the subject of extreme grooves and almost downright hooky harmonic form. It\'s good to hear these guys move on from their surgical masturbation to something more substantial. I\'m all for delicate glass soundscapes but you can only have so many before the personality is literally worn thin.\n\n<strong>Ø</strong> : <em>Oleva</em> : Sähkö\nThere are times when blocks of sound and imagined landscapes go hand in hand. Just wonderfully alien and funky, stuff that makes your torso vibrate. Contains probably my favorite Pink Floyd cover ever; \"set the controls for the heart of the sun\" is perfect for brooding, dark-sparked audio.\n\nVarious : <em>Round Black Ghosts</em> : <strong>~scape</strong>\nI have to be honest, the output of this label has been questionable for the past few years, so it\'s good to hear this collection of experimentally tinged and dub-inspired dance grooves. Pole stands out of course, but 2562\'s \"Channel Two\" is probably my favorite.\n\n<strong>Juxta Phona &amp; OffTheSky</strong> : <em>!Escape Kit!</em> : Somnia\nUnquestionably the best new thing to come out of Evan Bluetech\'s new label. There is a hefty amount of experimentalism balanced out by beats, supported by (of course) a dub atmosphere, but further punctuated by a free jazz influence. Right up my alley, the vibraphone work is especially sublime. Somnia has turned out not to be a hyper-ambient thing like I feared, I\'m encouraged by the diversity of their CD\'s so far, and I love the beautiful packaging. Some of the only CDs I still buy, in fact.\n\n<strong>Brassica</strong> : <em>Microvictories</em> : Tartaruga\nAnother CD I had to buy because of the packaging, Calika recommended this album, calling it the best thing he had heard this year. As you can see I had a hard enough time narrowing things down to 24, so naming something numero uno isn\'t really my bag. However, I absolutely love the approach in this music. The same sort of collage-inspired acousmatic blending but with his own unique voice in a way that draws you into what\'s happening, and before you know it the album is over. And you get an oragami turtle with it! How awesome is that?\n\n<strong>D\'incise</strong> : <em>Les Restes du Festin</em> : Test Tube\nThis music reminds me the most of music school, I\'m not sure why. I think there is a connection with composers I studied that made a subliminal crossing to the work of d\'incise, but it could be the natural fluidity of the sound that works the most like a classical string quartet. I enjoy the fact that he uses less beats but arrives at the same atmosphere as earlier albums, carrying the listener along in what seems to be a storyline that never quite reveals itself.\n\n<strong>Fennesz</strong> : <em>Black Sea</em> : Touch\nFinally a Fennesz I can listen to all the way through without thinking it was on repeat the whole time. There is a lot more diversity in this record than any other, showing a real willingness to develop beyond the distorted-guitar-drone rut. I\'ve heard other die-hard Fennesz fans poo-poo this album, so it\'s interesting I think it\'s more mature than others. It\'s similar to how I think Murcof has grown, I\'m looking forward to what he\'s doing this year as well.\n\n<strong>Portishead</strong> : <em>Third</em> : Universal Island\nUniquely spectacular in their own way. It thrills me to no end that they employed their own studio recordings for this instead of the sample-based thing. Not that Dummy isn\'t the best triphop album ever, but they\'ve shown here that the band is really a group with something musical to say, not just push out badass basslines. Beth Gibbons has the most sultry voice ever, I cannot get enough of her inflection.\n\n<strong>Autechre</strong> : <em>Quaristice</em> : Warp\nSay what you will, the \"bonus\" CD for this album is so much better than the \"original version\" of the tracks. I think it\'s an amazing escape into surreal dancescapes and fractured electro, it\'s very mature and non-egotistic Booth\'n\'Brown just having fun and making some cool ass tunes. The reason people hate these guys for doing things like this is because they won\'t drop their expectations and just listen to the sound, and want it all to be like 1997 again.\n\n<strong>Flying Lotus</strong> : <em>Los Angeles</em> : Warp\nWhat I had always wished Prefuse73 was.

It also helps this is not an hour of the same approach to beatcutting and voice splicing over and over again. I concede people are into that.

Swelling basslines and rim snaps, echoes filtering every which way, the sort of limping I love most. What starts off as a minimalistic break-beaty sort of dancehall album assuredly melts into easy rolling dubhouse.

I\'m used to a heavier hand when it comes to bpitch and this gal, so a well-crafted minimal techno album with some actual musical interest was the last thing I expected. The tunes are understated but driven in a way that especially matches the style, engaging but never harsh.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/middlemarch.png\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-228\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"Middlemarch\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/middlemarch-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>He Can Jog</strong> : <em>Middlemarch</em> : Audiobulb\nThere is a finesse with which HCJ can blend noise and consonance that\'s infectious and maybe just a little frightening.

Inspired miniatures, fully rounded songs, brief brightly colored sketchings; some of the best work he\'s done to date. A lot of the songs appeared in a podcast over the course of the year, but it is great to have a full collection of them under one cover.

Taylor Deupree and FourColor also stand out on this one, wonderful collection!\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-234\" title=\"luminarium\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/luminarium-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Tape</strong> : <em>Luminarium</em> : Häpna\nPolished construction and structure, with a perfect balance of acoustic and electric. These guys know how to make an ensemble be an ensemble and not just a band trying to add computers. The compositional acumen stands on its own in a collection of poignant, soft melodies and instrumentation that I haven\'t quite heard before in this context. Looking forward to more from this gang.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-235\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"magnetismthatelectricity\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/magnetismthatelectricity-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Magnetism, That Electricity...</em> : <strong>HighPoint LowLife</strong>\nAll the HPLL artists shine on this comp, but I especially like the dark analog synth contributions of Fink Industries (check out the remixes of his tracks too) and the contrasting bubbly lift of The Marcia Blaine School for Girls. There is such a wide range of styles on here that it\'s difficult to describe, but it\'s fantastic listening with a tropical forest of influences and approaches.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-236\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"sworn\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/sworn-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Anders Ilar</strong> : <em>Sworn</em> : Level\nMoving to the 4x4 side of things, a flawlessly constructed set of tracks. Haunting would be a good word to describe the melodies and dub feel, but really it\'s just good smooth techno with a nice groove and peppered funky.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/terminal.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-237\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"terminal\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/terminal-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Terminal</em> : <strong>Narita</strong>\nThis does have an Ilar track on it that could have easily been on <em>Sworn</em>, but it features so many other great techno folks that it deserves a place on my list for sure. Not to mention it\'s supposedly the very last release from the depths of Merck/Narita. I like working in the garden with this one thumping out to me... Senior Frio, Blamstrain, Arctic Hospital, Brothomstates, Yard, Adam Johnson... grow plants grow!\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/deathofatypographer.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-239\" title=\"deathofatypographer\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/deathofatypographer-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Byetone</strong> : <em>Death of a Typographer</em> : Raster-Noton\nI was pleasantly surprised when hearing this mechanical beast roar in my studio. Pure waveforms have become the subject of extreme grooves and almost downright hooky harmonic form. It\'s good to hear these guys move on from their surgical masturbation to something more substantial. I\'m all for delicate glass soundscapes but you can only have so many before the personality is literally worn thin.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/oleva.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-240\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"oleva\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/oleva-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Ø</strong> : <em>Oleva</em> : Sähkö\nThere are times when blocks of sound and imagined landscapes go hand in hand. Just wonderfully alien and funky, stuff that makes your torso vibrate. Contains probably my favorite Pink Floyd cover ever; \"set the controls for the heart of the sun\" is perfect for brooding, dark-sparked audio.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/round_black_ghosts.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-241\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"round_black_ghosts\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/round_black_ghosts-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a>Various : <em>Round Black Ghosts</em> : <strong>~scape</strong>\nI have to be honest, the output of this label has been questionable for the past few years, so it\'s good to hear this collection of experimentally tinged and dub-inspired dance grooves. Pole stands out of course, but 2562\'s \"Channel Two\" is probably my favorite.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/escapekit.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-242\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"escapekit\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/escapekit-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Juxta Phona &amp; OffTheSky</strong> : <em>!Escape Kit!</em> : Somnia\n\nUnquestionably the best new thing to come out of Evan Bluetech\'s new label. There is a hefty amount of experimentalism balanced out by beats, supported by (of course) a dub atmosphere, but further punctuated by a free jazz influence. Right up my alley, the vibraphone work is especially sublime. Somnia has turned out not to be a hyper-ambient thing like I feared, I\'m encouraged by the diversity of their CD\'s so far, and I love the beautiful packaging. Some of the only CDs I still buy, in fact.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/microvictories.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-243\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"microvictories\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/microvictories-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"105\" height=\"105\" /></a><strong>Brassica</strong> : <em>Microvictories</em> : Tartaruga\nAnother CD I had to buy because of the packaging, Calika recommended this album, calling it the best thing he had heard this year. As you can see I had a hard enough time narrowing things down to 24, so naming something numero uno isn\'t really my bag. However, I absolutely love the approach in this music. The same sort of collage-inspired acousmatic blending but with his own unique voice in a way that draws you into what\'s happening, and before you know it the album is over. And you get an oragami turtle with it! How awesome is that?\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lesrestesdufestin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-244\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"lesrestesdufestin\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lesrestesdufestin-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>D\'incise</strong> : <em>Les Restes du Festin</em> : Test Tube\nThis music reminds me the most of music school, I\'m not sure why. I think there is a connection with composers I studied that made a subliminal crossing to the work of d\'incise, but it could be the natural fluidity of the sound that works the most like a classical string quartet. I enjoy the fact that he uses less beats but arrives at the same atmosphere as earlier albums, carrying the listener along in what seems to be a storyline that never quite reveals itself.\n\n<strong>Fennesz</strong> : <em>Black Sea</em> : Touch\nFinally a Fennesz I can listen to all the way through without thinking it was on repeat the whole time. There is a lot more diversity in this record than any other, showing a real willingness to develop beyond the distorted-guitar-drone rut. I\'ve heard other die-hard Fennesz fans poo-poo this album, so it\'s interesting I think it\'s more mature than others. It\'s similar to how I think Murcof has grown, I\'m looking forward to what he\'s doing this year as well.\n\n<strong>Portishead</strong> : <em>Third</em> : Universal Island\nUniquely spectacular in their own way. It thrills me to no end that they employed their own studio recordings for this instead of the sample-based thing. Not that Dummy isn\'t the best triphop album ever, but they\'ve shown here that the band is really a group with something musical to say, not just push out badass basslines. Beth Gibbons has the most sultry voice ever, I cannot get enough of her inflection.\n\n<strong>Autechre</strong> : <em>Quaristice</em> : Warp\nSay what you will, the \"bonus\" CD for this album is so much better than the \"original version\" of the tracks. I think it\'s an amazing escape into surreal dancescapes and fractured electro, it\'s very mature and non-egotistic Booth\'n\'Brown just having fun and making some cool ass tunes. The reason people hate these guys for doing things like this is because they won\'t drop their expectations and just listen to the sound, and want it all to be like 1997 again.\n\n<strong>Flying Lotus</strong> : <em>Los Angeles</em> : Warp\nWhat I had always wished Prefuse73 was. And now I no longer have to! Artists who pull out just the right elements of hip hop that I like and pull it threadbare through an electronics sieve are A-OK in my book. It also helps this is not an hour of the same approach to beatcutting and voice splicing over and over again. I concede people are into that. I\'m not.\n\n<strong>Deadbeat</strong> : <em>Roots and Wire</em> : Wagon Repair\nIf you couldn\'t tell there is a definitely swing towards the reggae side of things in my library. Swelling basslines and rim snaps, echoes filtering every which way, the sort of limping I love most. What starts off as a minimalistic break-beaty sort of dancehall album assuredly melts into easy rolling dubhouse. I think it\'s the most well put together Deadbeat of any.\n\n<strong>Letna</strong> : <em>Tisza Meets Dunav</em> : Zymogen\nAh some of the most beautiful drones of the year. Very popular this style, it\'s only really successful when done with detail and depth. This album imagines me drifting between layers of impossibly smokey silk.\n\n<strong>Jimmy Behan</strong> : <em>In the Sudden Distance</em> : Zymogen\nA sort of minimal chamberwork, with an unevenness and simplicity that mingles the sound as if it belonged there the whole time. Definitely ambient, but more personal than a pure drone album, with smaller spaces and more intricacy.\n\nSome others worth mentioning:\n\nImplex Grace : <em>Through Luminescent Passages (I &amp; II)</em>\nHRSTA : <em>Ghosts Will Come Kiss Our Eyes</em>\nHol Baumann : <em>Human</em>\nFly Pan Am : <em>Ceux Qui Inventent N\'Ont Jamis Vecu</em>\nEvan Marc + Steve Hillage : <em>Dreamtime Submersible</em>\nElectricwest : <em>Divine de Vice</em>\nAlva Noto : <em>UNITXT</em>\nWilder Gonzales Agreda : <em>Se Tu Propio Totem</em>\nTrivium : <em>Shogun</em>\nTanox : <em>Astronomia de Balcon</em>\nSecret Chiefs 3 : <em>Xaphan: Book of Angels Vol. 9</em>\nop.cit. : <em>Under the Sweel</em>\nnaw : <em>vague terrain 10: digital dub</em>\nMotionfield : <em>Optical Flow</em>\nModel 500 : <em>Starlight remixes</em>\nLone : <em>Lemurian</em>\nVarious : <em>Dame Citrus</em>','My best 24 hours of music in 2008',0,'','inherit','open','open','','220-revision-7','','','2009-01-05 22:49:00','2009-01-06 05:49:00','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=252',0,'revision','',0),(253,2,'2009-01-05 22:53:15','2009-01-06 05:53:15','I like to make myself feel as if I\'m somehow close to the elusive community of electronic music. My problem, however, is that I am way too interested in multiple facets of music releases to pay attention in any style for very long. I seek out what really turns my ear, the gems of sound that are unique statements of purpose or individuality. Since I desire great pieces of listening, I spend time searching for it, which means I listen to a lot of not so great things too, and that goes double for netlabels. Needless to say I associate my music activities in a very close circle, I do very fringe stuff, really of a limited appeal on the grand scheme of things. My listening is only very more or less fringey than that, but I thought, well hell why not, I listen to all this music I may as well review it (however briefly) and share my twisted sense of what\'s good music to the dozen people who bother to look at my blog (and if you do, i thank you for at least being interested).

Pole stands out of course, but 2562\'s \"Channel Two\" is probably my favorite.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/escapekit.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-242\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"escapekit\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/escapekit-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Juxta Phona &amp; OffTheSky</strong> : <em>!Escape Kit!</em> : Somnia\n\nUnquestionably the best new thing to come out of Evan Bluetech\'s new label. There is a hefty amount of experimentalism balanced out by beats, supported by (of course) a dub atmosphere, but further punctuated by a free jazz influence. Right up my alley, the vibraphone work is especially sublime. Somnia has turned out not to be a hyper-ambient thing like I feared, I\'m encouraged by the diversity of their CD\'s so far, and I love the beautiful packaging. Some of the only CDs I still buy, in fact.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/microvictories.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-243\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"microvictories\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/microvictories-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"105\" height=\"105\" /></a><strong>Brassica</strong> : <em>Microvictories</em> : Tartaruga\nAnother CD I had to buy because of the packaging, Calika recommended this album, calling it the best thing he had heard this year. As you can see I had a hard enough time narrowing things down to 24, so naming something numero uno isn\'t really my bag. However, I absolutely love the approach in this music. The same sort of collage-inspired acousmatic blending but with his own unique voice in a way that draws you into what\'s happening, and before you know it the album is over. And you get an oragami turtle with it! How awesome is that?\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lesrestesdufestin.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-244\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"lesrestesdufestin\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/lesrestesdufestin-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>D\'incise</strong> : <em>Les Restes du Festin</em> : Test Tube\n\nThis music reminds me the most of music school, I\'m not sure why. I think there is a connection with composers I studied that made a subliminal crossing to the work of d\'incise, but it could be the natural fluidity of the sound that works the most like a classical string quartet. I enjoy the fact that he uses less beats but arrives at the same atmosphere as earlier albums, carrying the listener along in what seems to be a storyline that never quite reveals itself.<strong></strong>\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/blacksea.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-245\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"blacksea\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/blacksea-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"105\" height=\"105\" /></a><strong>Fennesz</strong> : <em>Black Sea</em> : Touch\nFinally a Fennesz I can listen to all the way through without thinking it was on repeat the whole time. There is a lot more diversity in this record than any other, showing a real willingness to develop beyond the distorted-guitar-drone rut. I\'ve heard other die-hard Fennesz fans poo-poo this album, so it\'s interesting I think it\'s more mature than others. It\'s similar to how I think Murcof has grown, I\'m looking forward to what he\'s doing this year as well.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/third.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-246\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"third\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/third-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Portishead</strong> : <em>Third</em> : Universal Island\nUniquely spectacular in their own way. It thrills me to no end that they employed their own studio recordings for this instead of the sample-based thing. Not that Dummy isn\'t the best triphop album ever, but they\'ve shown here that the band is really a group with something musical to say, not just push out badass basslines. Beth Gibbons has the most sultry voice ever, I cannot get enough of her inflection.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/quaristice.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-247\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"quaristice\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/quaristice-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"120\" height=\"120\" /></a><strong>Autechre</strong> : <em>Quaristice</em> : Warp\nSay what you will, the \"bonus\" CD for this album is so much better than the \"original version\" of the tracks. I think it\'s an amazing escape into surreal dancescapes and fractured electro, it\'s very mature and non-egotistic Booth\'n\'Brown just having fun and making some cool ass tunes. The reason people hate these guys for doing things like this is because they won\'t drop their expectations and just listen to the sound, and want it all to be like 1997 again.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/losangeles.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-248\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"losangeles\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/losangeles-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Flying Lotus</strong> : <em>Los Angeles</em> : Warp\nWhat I had always wished Prefuse73 was. And now I no longer have to! Artists who pull out just the right elements of hip hop that I like and pull it threadbare through an electronics sieve are A-OK in my book. It also helps this is not an hour of the same approach to beatcutting and voice splicing over and over again. I concede people are into that. I\'m not.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/rootsandwire.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-249\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"rootsandwire\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/rootsandwire-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"105\" height=\"105\" /></a><strong>Deadbeat</strong> : <em>Roots and Wire</em> : Wagon Repair\nIf you couldn\'t tell there is a definitely swing towards the reggae side of things in my library. Swelling basslines and rim snaps, echoes filtering every which way, the sort of limping I love most. What starts off as a minimalistic break-beaty sort of dancehall album assuredly melts into easy rolling dubhouse. I think it\'s the most well put together Deadbeat of any.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tiszameetsdunav.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-250\" style=\"margin: 4px;\" title=\"tiszameetsdunav\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/tiszameetsdunav-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"90\" height=\"90\" /></a><strong>Letna</strong> : <em>Tisza Meets Dunav</em> : Zymogen\nAh some of the most beautiful drones of the year. Very popular this style, it\'s only really successful when done with detail and depth. This album imagines me drifting between layers of impossibly smokey silk.\n\n<a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/inthesuddendistance.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-251\" title=\"inthesuddendistance\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/inthesuddendistance-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><strong>Jimmy Behan</strong> : <em>In the Sudden Distance</em> : Zymogen\nA sort of minimal chamberwork, with an unevenness and simplicity that mingles the sound as if it belonged there the whole time. Definitely ambient, but more personal than a pure drone album, with smaller spaces and more intricacy.\n\nSome others worth mentioning:\n\nImplex Grace : <em>Through Luminescent Passages (I &amp; II)</em>\nHRSTA : <em>Ghosts Will Come Kiss Our Eyes</em>\nHol Baumann : <em>Human</em>\nFly Pan Am : <em>Ceux Qui Inventent N\'Ont Jamis Vecu</em>\nEvan Marc + Steve Hillage : <em>Dreamtime Submersible</em>\nElectricwest : <em>Divine de Vice</em>\nAlva Noto : <em>UNITXT</em>\nWilder Gonzales Agreda : <em>Se Tu Propio Totem</em>\nTrivium : <em>Shogun</em>\nTanox : <em>Astronomia de Balcon</em>\nSecret Chiefs 3 : <em>Xaphan: Book of Angels Vol. 9</em>\nop.cit. : <em>Under the Sweel</em>\nnaw : <em>vague terrain 10: digital dub</em>\nMotionfield : <em>Optical Flow</em>\nModel 500 : <em>Starlight remixes</em>\nLone : <em>Lemurian</em>\nVarious : <em>Dame Citrus</em>','My best 24 hours of music in 2008',0,'','inherit','open','open','','220-revision-8','','','2009-01-05 22:53:15','2009-01-06 05:53:15','',220,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=253',0,'revision','',0),(254,2,'2008-11-12 15:45:05','2008-11-12 22:45:05','I try to include recommendable free and open source stuff, let me know if you have any suggestions!

how does it develop? we\'re moving into a world where musical styles - and listening - is more and more splayed, there are almost as many \"genres\" as there are individuals making music.\n\nthere is still something in the music that grabs the mind. it\'s difficult to pinpoint exactly what \"inspiration\" or \"genius\" a particular piece contains, to different folks these mean completely different things. i usually can\'t locate it in my own work, i certainly don\'t know where it happens or how to identify it. regardless, it shows up.\n\nso, in a very real way, it doesn\'t quite matter what it is i do, or how i do it, just that it is me doing it, in the most genuine way i can. this is the only way i know how to make art, and whether people like it or not is something i have to have others tell me','i don\'t know how to do anything',0,'','inherit','open','open','','265-revision','','','2009-03-02 09:46:34','2009-03-02 17:46:34','',265,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=266',0,'revision','',0),(268,2,'2009-03-03 21:18:56','2009-03-04 05:18:56','','img_0425',0,'','inherit','open','open','','img_0425','','','2009-03-03 21:18:56','2009-03-04 05:18:56','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_0425.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(269,2,'2009-03-11 23:01:29','2009-03-12 07:01:29','Here\'s something I thought I\'d never see myself do in my own lifetime: build a synthesizer from scratch.\r\n\r\nActually it\'s a simple design: 2 <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer#Astable_mode\" target=\"_blank\">555 timers in astable configuration</a> producing square-waves.

Nowhere to begin. Everywhere is a beginning, none end.\n\nEver felt overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of works out there? I do all the time, daily in fact. I tend to find new listening by discovery through association, especially through publishers and artists that cross stylistic boundaries. Sometimes I feel like I have a certain knack to picking things out, almost to the extent it feels random, but in context it really never is.\n\nSound sticks with me like nothing else. Some have the ability to remember words by rote and spit back movie quotes from things I haven\'t seen in 20 years, others can pick out anyone they\'ve met before in a crowd. I never forget a sound, you could say I have phonographic memory.\n\nIt\'s almost like having perfect pitch, but I can never relate anything absolutely to a specific frequency. Those square pointy hat people in tall robes would call it having \'relative pitch\', but I think it\'s more like aural memory. Sonic textures, bits of audio, melodies, harmonies, chord progressions, vocal personalities, wind players\' tone... I have a hard time not making an association when I hear things, it\'s like having a cochlear imprint.\n\nSo I am constantly searching for new things, seeking out what\'s new to my ears, both when performing and listening. The amount of people out there doing the same thing astounds me... I could listen for weeks and weeks, day in and day out, and not find anything interesting until after several months at it.\n\nAnd we are all being pressured to do it so fast, the releases come at us with unrelenting speed.','How to Listen?',0,'','publish','open','open','','how-to-listen','','','2010-05-06 08:55:10','2010-05-06 15:55:10','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=345',0,'post','',0),(330,2,'2009-01-07 11:58:12','2009-01-07 18:58:12','I try to include recommendable free and open source stuff, let me know if you have any suggestions! <em>craque circle_a craque dot_net</em>.\r\n\r\n<strong>News and Forums</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://sonikmatter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sonikmatter</a>: mind + music + technology</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.macmusic.org\" target=\"_blank\">MacMusic</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Editing and Analysis</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.soundhack.com/freeware.php\">Tom Erbe\'s SoundHack</a> and other assortied FFT goodies.</li>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.rogernicholsdigital.com/products.htm\">Roger Nichols Digital</a> has great analysis plugins, including a free one I use frequently called <a href=\"http://www.rogernicholsdigital.com/inspector.htm\">Inspector</a></li>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.klingbeil.com/spear/\">SPEAR</a> (Sinusoidal Partial Editing Analysis and Resynthesis) is a fairly new and promising, with some very neato graphic tools</li>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://www.hairersoft.com\">Amadeus Pro</a> is one of the better low-priced audio editors out there.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.audiofile-engineering.com/waveeditor/\" target=\"_blank\">Wave Editor</a> is an impressive MacOSX app from Audiofile, it may just be my next favorite sound app.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Audacity</a> is a good free, open-source audio editor and recorder.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.sonicvisualiser.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Sonic Visualiser</a> is a graphical interface for sound file analysis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Looping and Performance</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Brian Eno has a new generative application for the iphone called <a href=\"http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=292792586&amp;mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Bloom</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.rjdj.me\" target=\"_blank\">RjDj</a> for the iphone is based on PD, using \"sensory input to generate and control the music...\"</li>\r\n	<li>Shawn Hatfield (aka <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Twerk\" target=\"_blank\">Twerk</a>) provides his max/msp patches for free downloads, start with <a href=\"http://shawnhatfield.blogspot.com/2007/12/burnt-toast.html\" target=\"_blank\">Burnt Toast</a> (one I\'ve used live) or <a href=\"http://shawnhatfield.blogspot.com/2007/12/mooquencer.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mooquencer</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://plasq.com/musolomo/\" target=\"_blank\">Musolomo</a> is a performance-oriented sampling looper AU plugin, perfect for use with <a href=\"http://www.ableton.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Live</a>.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://noise.io\" target=\"_blank\">noise.io</a> is a synth and sequencer for the iphone, not out yet but looking forward to it!</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.renoise.com\" target=\"_blank\">Renoise</a> uses tracker-style technology for composing, costs some money but the free version is fully featured.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Sequencing</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://lucidmac.com/products/elysium\" target=\"_blank\">Elysium</a> is a \"generative MIDI sequencer\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Modular Music Making</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://cycling74.com/\">Cycling 74</a> is the home of the ubiquitous <a href=\"http://cycling74.com/products/maxmsp\">Max/MSP</a></li>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://puredata.info/\" target=\"_blank\">PureData</a> (PD) \"is a real-time graphical programming environment for audio, video, and graphical processing\" - what amounts to the \"free\" version of Max/MSP, as it is all based on code by the same guy (Miller Puckette)</li>\r\n	<li> <a href=\"http://plogue.com/\">Plogue Bidule</a> is a max/msp-like audio manipulator</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Free Players and Visualizers </strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://cogx.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cog</a> is an open source player for MacOSX only; natively plays OGG and FLAC, among others. <a href=\"http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"></a></li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://getsongbird.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Songbird</a> is a multi-platform player and librarian with a plug-in architecture based on the Mozilla browser engine (same as Firefox); definitely going for an iTunes look, but ultimately a lot more customizable.

When I get home, I don\'t want to do much except unravel from the day, my motivation to create is low - not necessarily because I don\'t want to make music, but because the enormous task of what to do with it after I\'m done isn\'t something I feel like dealing with any longer.\r\n\r\nSo I\'m looking forward to this week in particular: in the coming days I\'ll continue preparation and practicing for my set on 12/12, where I can just play music and not worry about computers in the process.

In fact, I didn\'t do much of anything except plan my set for <a href=\"http://betalevel.com/2009/12/12/resonance-6/\" target=\"_blank\">next Saturday</a>, play Super Mario Bros Wii, and work through the pileup of recorded Showtime serials with my wife.\r\n\r\nA good deal of people I know that make music on computers do so as a second life to their work day on them. Multitasking on computing problems at the same time as applying yourself creatively - and otherwise using software, interfacing with recording gear, attached hard drives, sound drivers, etc... all while you\'re also concentrating on finishing that perl script for your job (if you\'re lucky enough to be in an environment where your work computer can double as a creative tool), and of course keeping up with \"the scene\" in blog format or forums or twitter and social networks, not to mention keeping up with what feels like an exponentially growing volume of album releases - is not a very sustainable way to work.\r\n\r\nSwitching between brain processes like this often makes me feel fractured, like I am not quite in touch with the things that I identify with creating art. The myriad problems of computer technology are an infinitely complex layer of interaction which I can frankly do without. The irony of this is that before I went into a highly disciplined performance school, I had a \"designed\" undergrad major in music, focusing on Composition and Music Technology (a type of degree that\'s now been heavily formalized in many universities, and is no longer rare at all). From that point forward, technology became a very important part of my musical description.\r\n\r\nAt some point, however, technology took over. It\'s taken me many years to see in retrospect that what I was doing isn\'t quite what I loved to do as a performer and an artist, and splitting my attention between things wasn\'t helping my attempts at doing great things. As an extension of that, I believe my will to do original things was diminished by the layer of complexity and confusion brought on by an intervening computer operating system. Pretty soon, the issues I faced in my day-job became the same issues I faced in music making on the computer, and it wasn\'t long that I couldn\'t handle that union of cognitive space. I\'ve now found myself not wanting to open a computer at all after I get home from work.\r\n\r\nThis may have a lot to do with circumstantial things: my day-job work environment isn\'t great (bright fluorescent lamps, no privacy, high stress when on-call, poor management, general chaos), and I\'ve had to sideline my musical activities in lieu of getting back up to speed on things I need for this job. When I get home, I don\'t want to do much except unravel from the day, my motivation to create is low - not necessarily because I don\'t want to make music, but because the enormous task of what to do with it after I\'m done isn\'t something I feel like dealing with any longer.\r\n\r\nSo I\'m looking forward to this week in particular: in the coming days I\'ll continue preparation and practicing for my set on 12/12, where I can just play music and not worry about computers in the process. I have some hurdles to overcome - fixing/patching the new modular so that at least *some* of it works, paring down the complexity of my instruments - so I will be forced to focus on music in the way I love: brainpower in the pursuit of creativity.','The Importance of Computer Silence',0,'','inherit','open','open','','332-revision-4','','','2009-12-07 11:54:01','2009-12-07

20:58:59','2010-10-16 03:58:59','I happen to be a voracious reader. I would probably write more if I didn\'t read so much. One thing I\'ve noticed is the tendency to obsess on a single writer\'s work: someone or something will turn me on to a specific author, I\'ll read one of his or her works, and immediately want to read everything they\'ve ever done. On occasion I accomplish this, but sometimes the task is simply too great.\r\n\r\nCurrently I\'m on an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C_Clarke\" target=\"_blank\">Arthur C. Clarke (CBE)</a> trip, embarking with <em><strong>Childhood\'s End</strong></em> after recently finishing <em><strong>Rendezvous with Rama</strong></em>. To be honest these purchases were inspired by Clarke\'s death in March of 2008, when I remembered how he changed my life while a freshman in high school.\r\n\r\nIt\'s pretty interesting how we remember things, especially points in time that present themselves as an immediate recollection, almost painting-like in their clarity. When I first was assigned the task of reading the novel <em><strong>2001</strong></em> as a freshman in the remote western mountains of North Carolina, there was some sort of stencil work done on my brain. I recall a very specific day in that classroom, noticing the green of a fresh blackboard, where I was so incredibly thrilled with this fantastic view into the Universe, that I immediately picked up <strong><em>2010</em></strong> and kept reading. Probably it was two or three years before I saw the accompanying films.\r\n\r\nThen there was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_gibson\" target=\"_blank\">William Gibson</a>. I read <em><strong>Neuromancer</strong></em> and was completely hooked: I went through a barrage of Gibson novels right in a row, staying up late into the night when I should have been practicing, but instead being sucked into fantasies of Black Ice and the fast paced action of transient networks and cyberpunk, reality TV and a California civil war, popular meme-based advertising and terrorist plots - the language and ideas all resonate with me strongly.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps this was all an extension of my admitted affairs with the art and writings of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs\" target=\"_blank\">William S. Burroughs</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bowles\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Bowles</a> (his Wikipedia entry curiously devoid of photographs); authors whose catalog I have yet to extinguish but to whose prose I am drawn. Bowles holds a special place with me because I really got into his compositions for voice, singing many of them in recitals.

I would probably write more if I didn\'t read so much. One thing I\'ve noticed is the tendency to obsess on a single writer\'s work: someone or something will turn me on to a specific author, I\'ll read one of his or her works, and immediately want to read everything they\'ve ever done. On occasion I accomplish this, but sometimes the task is simply too great.\n\nCurrently I\'m on an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C_Clarke\" target=\"_blank\">Arthur C. Clarke (CBE)</a> trip, embarking with <em><strong>Childhood\'s End</strong></em> after recently finishing <em><strong>Rendezvous with Rama</strong></em>. To be honest these purchases were inspired by Clarke\'s death in March of 2008, when I remembered how he changed my life while a freshman in high school.\n\nIt\'s pretty interesting how we remember things, especially points in time that present themselves as an immediate recollection, almost painting-like in their clarity. When I first was assigned the task of reading the novel <em><strong>2001</strong></em> as a freshman in the remote western mountains of North Carolina, there was some sort of stencil work done on my brain. I recall a very specific day in that classroom, noticing the green of a fresh blackboard, where I was so incredibly thrilled with this fantastic view into the Universe, that I immediately picked up <strong><em>2010</em></strong> and kept reading. Probably it was two or three years before I saw the accompanying films.\n\nThen there was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_gibson\" target=\"_blank\">William Gibson</a>. I read <em><strong>Neuromancer</strong></em> and was completely hooked: I went through a barrage of Gibson novels right in a row, staying up late into the night when I should have been practicing, but instead being sucked into fantasies of Black Ice and the fast paced action of transient networks and cyberpunk, reality TV and a California civil war, popular meme-based advertising and terrorist plots - the language and ideas all resonate with me strongly.\n\nBut perhaps this was all an extension of my admitted affairs with the art and writings of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Burroughs\" target=\"_blank\">William S. Burroughs</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bowles\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Bowles</a> (his Wikipedia entry curiously devoid of photographs); authors whose catalog I have yet to extinguish but to whose prose I am drawn. Bowles holds a special place with me because I really got into his compositions for voice, singing many of them in recitals. My next multi-book adventure will be <strong><em>The Red Night Trilogy</em></strong>, parts of which I\'ve read and even adapted to music.\n\nI\'m not sure what it is, but perhaps others have the same sort of drive I do, to explore authors and artists to whatever extent necessary. This leads me to wonder whether these types of minds will always exist, regardless of what we think \'technology\' is doing to our ability to appreciate non-technical forms of expression. Just because our mediums change doesn\'t mean the human spirit has lost the ability to create beauty.','',0,'','inherit','open','open','','369-revision','','','2010-10-15 20:58:31','2010-10-16 03:58:31','',369,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=370',0,'revision','',0),(374,2,'2010-11-04 23:03:43','2010-11-05 06:03:43','This past weekend we presented ourselves in regalia of the <strong><em>zombie</em></strong>, partying until the early single digits at my good friend Chad\'s.\r\n\r\nI have played music at his Halloween parties for as long as I\'ve lived in California, down in <em>Newport Beach</em> as well as <em>Fullerton</em>.

So here are some of the better links I\'ve uncovered that are useful for getting your head around the entire idea of designing a matrix mixer.\r\n\r\nA lot of good guidance here, using OmAmps for buffering, though I think the best thing about this page is the nice wiring schematic at the very bottom on how to wire buses.\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://sound.westhost.com/project129.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://sound.westhost.com/project129.htm</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThis JFET style mixer is basically a step up from a passive mixer with no buffers, sometimes used in place of an OpAmp:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.aaroncake.net/circuits/mixer1.asp\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.aaroncake.net/circuits/mixer1.asp</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThese are a selection of great starting points for learning how to build simple input/output buffers, focused mostly on JFET, but with some discussion of JFET OpAmps:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.muzique.com/lab/buffers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.muzique.com/lab/buffers.htm</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\nKen Stone\'s well known mixer designs.

I discovered this by accident, but really like the gestural aspect of it so much that I\'m planning on building a touch interface into the final design. :)\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is finally mixed into another dual opamp, with a follower/buffer and a high-gain resonant Q notch filter to add some harmonics and really cool sweep possibilities.\r\n\r\nExcited to have this core design done, LOVE playing with it! Now it\'s just a matter tweaking and expansion.','\"Booglitchoo\" Synth Prototype',0,'','inherit','open','open','','431-revision-7','','','2011-06-22 23:51:17','2011-06-23 06:51:17','',431,'http://sounding.com/blog/2011/06/22/431-revision-7/',0,'revision','',0),(440,2,'2011-07-01 16:19:02','2011-07-01 23:19:02','','Auto Draft',0,'','inherit','open','open','','439-revision','','','2011-07-01 16:19:02','2011-07-01 23:19:02','',439,'http://sounding.com/blog/2011/07/01/439-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(442,2,'2011-08-31 11:00:59','2011-08-31 18:00:59','Just in case you missed it, SoundWalk Long Beach 2011 is just around the corner!

So I\'ve been searching high and low for higher quality versions of these videos.\r\n\r\nIt is way out of print, but you can still find the VHS version... they\'ve been released on DVD in Europe, but only in PAL format. In the digital age, this is unacceptable for me, so I finally came across someone who ripped the videos and I now have - albeit in relatively lowres VHS-sourced AVI files - all four on my iPod. The quality is what you\'d expect from a 30-year old VHS tape, but it\'s not horrible.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been struggling about whether to post them myself, but today Ubuweb has answered my prayers and posted all of them for me (lo and behold, the quality is no better than my collected AVI files, I suspect they may have procured them from the same source).\r\n\r\nSo here they are, I highly recommend... they are the greatest films about avant garde music you\'ll ever find anywhere:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><a href=\"http://www.ubu.com/film/greenaway_cage.html\" target=\"_blank\">4merican

\"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something attractive on this list. Click on the album title to find where you can get the release; you\'ll find an amazing amount of these are on bandcamp and can be streamed for free. These also aren\'t in any particular order, they all stand alone on their own and can\'t really be compared to each other as a \"top-#\" list. So without further a\'do...\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/passed_me_by.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-585\" title=\"passed me by\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/passed_me_by-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/we_stay_together.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-586\" title=\"we stay together\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/we_stay_together-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Andy+Stott\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Stott</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30057\" target=\"_blank\">Passed Me By</a> / <a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=32820\" target=\"_blank\">We Stay Together</a></em>\r\nModern Love\r\n\r\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-583\" title=\"OR\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/or-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" />\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Kangding+Ray\" target=\"_blank\">Kangding Ray</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30332\" target=\"_blank\">OR</a></em>\r\nRaster-Noton\r\n\r\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums of strategically placed pitch-shifted static and buzzing and genuinely enjoy it. These tracks, however, have a personality that stands out among all the other click-pop-n-wrinkle hardcore glitch. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/forever_lost.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-592\" title=\"forever lost\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/forever_lost-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/palma.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-604\" title=\"palma\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/palma-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aril+Brikha\" target=\"_blank\">Aril Brikha</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33593\" target=\"_blank\">Palma</a> / <a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29493\" target=\"_blank\">Forever Frost</a>\r\n</em>Art of Vengeance\r\n\r\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/feral.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-591\" title=\"feral\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/feral-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Menche\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Menche</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\r\nSub Rosa\r\n\r\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, so definitely looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.kult_.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-600\" title=\"liber kult\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.kult_-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.temple.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-601\" title=\"liber temple\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.temple-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.nox_.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-611\" title=\"liber nox\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.nox_-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.dogma_.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-598\" title=\"liber dogma\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.dogma_-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dog%2C+The\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Dog</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-dogma\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Dogma</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-kult\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\r\n</a><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-temple\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\r\n</a><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-nox\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Nox (Book 3 Ov 3)</a></em>\r\nDust Science\r\n\r\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated - (just look at the title) - an immensely enjoyable equal footing of structure and form with materials instead of turning into some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant, thickly colorful expositions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hash1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-594\" title=\"hash1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hash1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hash2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-595\" title=\"hash2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/hash2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/DeepChord\" target=\"_blank\">DeepChord</a></strong>\r\n<em>Hash Bar Remnants, <a href=\"http://www.somarecords.com/shop/music/soma_310/\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.somarecords.com/shop/music/soma_319/\" target=\"_blank\">Part II</a></em>\r\nSoma\r\n\r\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/parabolas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-605\" title=\"parabolas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/parabolas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Tejada\" target=\"_blank\">John Tejada</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/parabolas_dolp_cd\" target=\"_blank\">Parabolas</a>\r\n</em>Kompakt\r\n\r\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums.

I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-589\" title=\"amen2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-588\" title=\"amen1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-607\" title=\"xwxwxwxwv\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\r\nPhantasma Disques\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\r\nTundra Dub\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in

The label, however, seems to be having an identity crisis. The demo for this CD (which I happened upon at work, left alone on the kitchen table) has it on the \"Mille-Plateaux\" label, which used to be the more abstract side of ForceInc (before changing owners), but they seem to have \'moved\' the release to \"Force-X-Inc\", which used to be the <em>harder techno</em> side of the label, that is now - especially considering this record - confusingly not that at all. This isn\'t your father\'s ForceInc, unfortunately.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha</strong>\n<em>Palma EP</em>\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. This EP provides a glimmer of that sound, a small sliver of a view into a circling mass of that driving dance beat, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display (and frankly this guy can be super cheeseball, so kudos there) and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions</em>\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma / [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says these are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. Dogma, on the other hand, is close to one of my favorite listens of the year, released to be a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at Buzz). I share some heritage with the album too, mastered as it is by my friend Shawn (aka Twerk) over at AudibleOddities.\n\n<strong>Deep Chord</strong>\n<em>Hash Bar Remnants, Pts.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout.

The demo for this CD (which I happened upon at work, left alone on the kitchen table) has it on the \"Mille-Plateaux\" label, which used to be the more abstract side of ForceInc (before changing owners), but they seem to have \'moved\' the release to \"Force-X-Inc\", which used to be the <em>harder techno</em> side of the label, that is now - especially considering this record - confusingly not that at all. This isn\'t your father\'s ForceInc, unfortunately.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha</strong>\n<em>Palma EP</em>\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. This EP provides a glimmer of that sound, a small sliver of a view into a circling mass of that driving dance beat, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display (and frankly this guy can be super cheeseball, so kudos there) and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions</em>\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma\nLiber [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

I &amp; II</em>\nEchospace\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong>Aeroc</strong>\n<em>R+B=?</em>\nGhostly\n\n<strong>John Tejada\n</strong><em>Parabolas\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n\n<strong>Matthew Mercer</strong>\n<em>Pianissimo Possibile</em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated... equal footing with the structure and form instead of attempting some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant expositions. These tracks always make me check the iPod for what artist it is.\n\n<strong>Logreybeam</strong>\n<em>Perhaps\n</em>Les Enregistrements Variables\n\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I have under good authority that\'s the eventual goal of these tracks. Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong>~▲†▲~</strong>\n~▲††▲~\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong>∆AIMON</strong>\n<em>AMEN / AMEN Remixes</em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

The demo for this CD (which I happened upon at work, left alone on the kitchen table) has it on the \"Mille-Plateaux\" label, which used to be the more abstract side of ForceInc (before changing owners), but they seem to have \'moved\' the release to \"Force-X-Inc\", which used to be the <em>harder techno</em> side of the label, that is now - especially considering this record - confusingly not that at all. This isn\'t your father\'s ForceInc, unfortunately.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha</strong>\n<em>Palma EP</em>\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. This EP provides a glimmer of that sound, a small sliver of a view into a circling mass of that driving dance beat, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display (and frankly this guy can be a massive cheeseball, so kudos there) and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Daniel Menche</strong>\n<em>Feral</em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation. This noise outing is not as harsh as you\'d expect from say a Merzbow release (no overwhelming towers of high-pitched feedback here), and although I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, it\'s on the down-low and quite engaging, even as passive entertainment while I work. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Super glad I bumped into this release.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions\n</em>Schematic\n\nThere\'s a sort of dark electro sound that I like enormously, and the sort that uses way too many 80\'s idioms. Unfortunately, the artists who write the former too often specialize in the latter. So it\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to the dark side, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, .\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma\nLiber [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>). I share some heritage with the album too, mastered as it is by my buddy Shawn (aka Twerk) over at <a href=\"http://www.audibleoddities.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AudibleOddities</a>.\n\n<strong>Deep Chord</strong>\n<em>Hash Bar Remnants, Pts. I &amp; II</em>\nEchospace\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong>Aeroc</strong>\n<em>R+B=?</em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n<strong>John Tejada\n</strong><em>Parabolas\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n\n<strong>Matthew Mercer</strong>\n<em>Pianissimo Possibile</em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated... equal footing with the structure and form instead of attempting some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant expositions. These tracks always make me check the iPod for what artist it is.\n\n<strong>Logreybeam</strong>\n<em>Perhaps\n</em>Les Enregistrements Variables\n\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I have under good authority that\'s the eventual goal of these tracks. Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong>~▲†▲~</strong>\n~▲††▲~\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong>∆AIMON</strong>\n<em>AMEN / AMEN Remixes</em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

Are you ready?\n\nAre you sure? ;)\n\n<strong>Kangding Ray</strong>\n<em>OR</em>\nRaster-Noton\n\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums at a time and genuinely enjoy it on a purely sonic level. And I do that a lot! It\'s just that, sometimes when you\'re commuting, you just need a well placed melodic hook alongside the crunchy drone to propel those glitchy electric spark beats along. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n\n<strong>Andy Stott</strong>\n<em>Passed Me By / We Stay Together</em>\nModern Love\n\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha\n</strong><em>Palma / Forever Frost\n</em>Art of Vengeance\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into a circling mass of filtered 4x4 dance beats, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Daniel Menche</strong>\n<em>Feral</em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma\nLiber [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>). I share some heritage with the album too, mastered as it is by my buddy Shawn (aka Twerk) over at <a href=\"http://www.audibleoddities.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AudibleOddities</a>.\n\n<strong>Deep Chord</strong>\n<em>Hash Bar Remnants, Pts. I &amp; II</em>\nEchospace\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong>Aeroc</strong>\n<em>R+B=?</em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n<strong>John Tejada\n</strong><em>Parabolas\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n\n<strong>Matthew Mercer</strong>\n<em>Pianissimo Possibile</em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated... equal footing with the structure and form instead of attempting some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant expositions. These tracks always make me check the iPod for what artist it is.\n\n<strong>Logreybeam</strong>\n<em>Perhaps\n</em>Les Enregistrements Variables\n\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I have under good authority that\'s the eventual goal of these tracks. Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong>~▲†▲~</strong>\n~▲††▲~\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong>∆AIMON</strong>\n<em>AMEN / AMEN Remixes</em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

But to be honest, at this point in the electronica game, there is nothing better than someone who comes along and hits a style out of the park. The label, however, seems to be having an identity crisis. The demo for this CD (which I happened upon at work, left alone on the kitchen table) has it on the \"Mille-Plateaux\" label, which used to be the more abstract side of ForceInc (before changing owners), but they seem to have \'moved\' the release to \"Force-X-Inc\", which used to be the <em>harder techno</em> side of the label, that is now - especially considering this record - confusingly not that at all.

I can listen to entire albums at a time and genuinely enjoy it on a purely sonic level. And I do that a lot! It\'s just that, sometimes when you\'re commuting, you just need a well placed melodic hook alongside the crunchy drone to propel those glitchy electric spark beats along. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n\n<strong>Andy Stott</strong>\n<em>Passed Me By / We Stay Together</em>\nModern Love\n\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n\n<strong>Marow</strong>\n<em>+ - 0</em>\nMille-Plateaux / Force-X-Inc.\n\nMinimal sound, yes. Sparsely peppered beats, check. Thinly harmonized pointillistic impressions of melody, present and called for. You could even say somewhat, well, derivative. But to be honest, at this point in the electronica game, there is nothing better than someone who comes along and hits a style out of the park. The label, however, seems to be having an identity crisis. The demo for this CD (which I happened upon at work, left alone on the kitchen table) has it on the \"Mille-Plateaux\" label, which used to be the more abstract side of ForceInc (before changing owners), but they seem to have \'moved\' the release to \"Force-X-Inc\", which used to be the <em>harder techno</em> side of the label, that is now - especially considering this record - confusingly not that at all. This isn\'t your father\'s ForceInc, unfortunately.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha</strong>\n<em>Palma EP</em>\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. This EP provides a glimmer of that sound, a small sliver of a view into a circling mass of that driving dance beat, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display (and frankly this guy can be a massive cheeseball, so kudos there) and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Daniel Menche</strong>\n<em>Feral</em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation. This noise outing is not as harsh as you\'d expect from say a Merzbow release (no overwhelming towers of high-pitched feedback here), and although I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, it\'s on the down-low and quite engaging, even as passive entertainment while I work. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Super glad I bumped into this release.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to the dark side, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular deep techno feel from the label. Surprising samples contrast with minimal vertical lines of percussion and jazz-based swelling tones placed around the stereo spectrum.\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma\nLiber [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability.

I can listen to entire albums at a time and genuinely enjoy it on a purely sonic level. And I do that a lot! It\'s just that, sometimes when you\'re commuting, you just need a well placed melodic hook alongside the crunchy drone to propel those glitchy electric spark beats along. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n\n<strong>Andy Stott</strong>\n<em>Passed Me By / We Stay Together</em>\nModern Love\n\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n\n<strong>Marow</strong>\n<em>+ - 0</em>\nMille-Plateaux / Force-X-Inc.\n\nMinimal sound, yes. Sparsely peppered beats, check. Thinly harmonized pointillistic impressions of melody, present and called for. You could even say somewhat, well, derivative. But to be honest, at this point in the electronica game, there is nothing better than someone who comes along and hits a style out of the park. The label, however, seems to be having an identity crisis. The demo for this CD (which I happened upon at work, left alone on the kitchen table) has it on the \"Mille-Plateaux\" label, which used to be the more abstract side of ForceInc (before changing owners), but they seem to have \'moved\' the release to \"Force-X-Inc\", which used to be the <em>harder techno</em> side of the label, that is now - especially considering this record - confusingly not that at all. This isn\'t your father\'s ForceInc, unfortunately.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha</strong>\n<em>Palma EP</em>\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. This EP provides a glimmer of that sound, a small sliver of a view into a circling mass of that driving dance beat, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display (and frankly this guy can be a massive cheeseball, so kudos there) and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Daniel Menche</strong>\n<em>Feral</em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation. This noise outing is not as harsh as you\'d expect from say a Merzbow release (no overwhelming towers of high-pitched feedback here), and although I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, it\'s on the down-low and quite engaging, even as passive entertainment while I work. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Super glad I bumped into this release.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to the dark side, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular deep techno feel from the label. Surprising samples contrast with minimal vertical lines of percussion and jazz-based swelling tones placed around the stereo spectrum... sounds typical, the arrangements are anything but.\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma\nLiber [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

I & II</em>\nEchospace\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong>Aeroc</strong>\n<em>R+B=?</em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n<strong>John Tejada\n</strong><em>Parabolas\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n\n<strong>Matthew Mercer</strong>\n<em>Pianissimo Possibile</em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated... equal footing with the structure and form instead of attempting some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant expositions. These tracks always make me check the iPod for what artist it is.\n\n<strong>Logreybeam</strong>\n<em>Perhaps\n</em>Les Enregistrements Variables\n\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I have under good authority that\'s the eventual goal of these tracks. Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong>~▲†▲~</strong>\n~▲††▲~\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong>∆AIMON</strong>\n<em>AMEN / AMEN Remixes</em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity.\n\n \n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity.\n\n \n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

Are you ready?\n\nAre you sure? ;)\n\n<strong>Kangding Ray</strong>\n<em>OR</em>\nRaster-Noton\n\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums at a time and genuinely enjoy it on a purely sonic level. And I do that a lot! It\'s just that, sometimes when you\'re commuting, you just need a well placed melodic hook alongside the crunchy drone to propel those glitchy electric spark beats along. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n\n<strong>Andy Stott</strong>\n<em>Passed Me By / We Stay Together</em>\nModern Love\n\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha\n</strong><em>Palma / Forever Frost\n</em>Art of Vengeance\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Daniel Menche</strong>\n<em>Feral</em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em>The God Particle\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em>Demissions\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n<strong>Margaret Dygas</strong>\n<em>Margaret Dygas</em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n<strong>The Black Dog\n</strong><em>Liber Dogma\nLiber [ Kult / Temple / Nox ]</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>). I share some heritage with the album too, mastered as it is by my buddy Shawn (aka Twerk) over at <a href=\"http://www.audibleoddities.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AudibleOddities</a>.\n\n<strong>Deep Chord</strong>\n<em>Hash Bar Remnants, Pts. I &amp; II</em>\nEchospace\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong>Aeroc</strong>\n<em>R+B=?</em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong>Amon Tobin</strong>\n<em>ISAM (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

I &amp; II</em>\nEchospace\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong>Aeroc</strong>\n<em>R+B=?</em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n<strong>John Tejada\n</strong><em>Parabolas\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n\n<strong>Matthew Mercer</strong>\n<em>Pianissimo Possibile</em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated... equal footing with the structure and form instead of attempting some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant expositions. These tracks always make me check the iPod for what artist it is.\n\n<strong>Logreybeam</strong>\n<em>Perhaps\n</em>Les Enregistrements Variables\n\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I have under good authority that\'s the eventual goal of these tracks. Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong>~▲†▲~</strong>\n~▲††▲~\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong>∆AIMON</strong>\n<em>AMEN / AMEN Remixes</em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\n<ul>\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\n	<li>blah</li>\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-84','','','2012-01-10 21:49:05','2012-01-11 05:49:05','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-84/',0,'revision','',0),(579,2,'2012-01-10 23:08:10','2012-01-11 07:08:10','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\n\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

Are you ready?\n\nAre you sure? ;)\n\n<strong>Kangding Ray</strong>\n<em>OR</em>\nRaster-Noton\n\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums of strategically placed pitch-shifted static and buzzing and genuinely enjoy it. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n\n<strong>Andy Stott</strong>\n<em>Passed Me By / We Stay Together</em>\nModern Love\n\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n\n<strong>Aril Brikha\n</strong><em>Palma / Forever Frost\n</em>Art of Vengeance\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong>Daniel Menche</strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\n\n<strong>Shpongle\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong>Phoenecia\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dog%2C+The\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Dog</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-dogma\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Dogma</a>\nLiber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-kult\" target=\"_blank\">Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-temple\" target=\"_blank\">Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-nox\" target=\"_blank\">Nox</a> (Book 3 Ov 3)</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aeroc\" target=\"_blank\">Aeroc</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33468\" target=\"_blank\">R+B=?</a></em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs.

I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs.

Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-89','','','2012-01-10 23:26:08','2012-01-11 07:26:08','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-89/',0,'revision','',0),(583,2,'2012-01-10 23:27:32','2012-01-11 07:27:32','','OR',0,'','inherit','open','open','','or','','','2012-01-10 23:27:32','2012-01-11 07:27:32','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/or.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(584,2,'2012-01-10 23:26:12','2012-01-11 07:26:12','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable. Click on the album title to find where you can get the release (an amazing amount of these are on bandcamp), and follow the artist links to see more releases.\r\n\r\nAre you ready?\r\n\r\nAre you sure? ;)\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Kangding+Ray\" target=\"_blank\">Kangding Ray</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30332\" target=\"_blank\">OR</a></em>\r\nRaster-Noton\r\n\r\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums of strategically placed pitch-shifted static and buzzing and genuinely enjoy it. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Andy+Stott\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Stott</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30057\" target=\"_blank\">Passed Me By</a> / <a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=32820\" target=\"_blank\">We Stay Together</a></em>\r\nModern Love\r\n\r\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aril+Brikha\" target=\"_blank\">Aril Brikha</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33593\" target=\"_blank\">Palma</a> / <a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29493\" target=\"_blank\">Forever Frost</a>\r\n</em>Art of Vengeance\r\n\r\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Menche\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Menche</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\r\nSub Rosa\r\n\r\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dog%2C+The\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Dog</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-dogma\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Dogma</a>\r\nLiber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-kult\" target=\"_blank\">Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\r\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-temple\" target=\"_blank\">Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\r\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-nox\" target=\"_blank\">Nox</a> (Book 3 Ov 3)</em>\r\nDust Science\r\n\r\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\n\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable. Click on the album title to find where you can get the release (an amazing amount of these are on bandcamp), and follow the artist links to see more releases.\n\nAre you ready?\n\nAre you sure? ;)\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-583\" title=\"OR\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/or-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" />\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Kangding+Ray\" target=\"_blank\">Kangding Ray</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30332\" target=\"_blank\">OR</a></em>\nRaster-Noton\n\nI like this label, I really do. I can listen to entire albums of strategically placed pitch-shifted static and buzzing and genuinely enjoy it. Check out older albums too, all extremely nice static buzz filled phat bass ear candy with more of an organic character than your typical release from here.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Andy+Stott\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Stott</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30057\" target=\"_blank\">Passed Me By</a> / <a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=32820\" target=\"_blank\">We Stay Together</a></em>\nModern Love\n\nI am so happy the throbbing washing machine multi-textured off-balance-beat dub techno sound has continued strong thanks to this artist. The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum. There emerge strange hypnotizing rhythms, thankfully not always percussively so, drawing the ear into a swaying communion.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aril+Brikha\" target=\"_blank\">Aril Brikha</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33593\" target=\"_blank\">Palma</a> / <a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29493\" target=\"_blank\">Forever Frost</a>\n</em>Art of Vengeance\n\nGetting involved in the Chicago house DJ scene made me a huge fawning sucker for that special deep style of dimly lit underground basement club speakers-in-your-ears house. These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Menche\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Menche</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dog%2C+The\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Dog</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-dogma\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Dogma</a>\nLiber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-kult\" target=\"_blank\">Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-temple\" target=\"_blank\">Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-nox\" target=\"_blank\">Nox</a> (Book 3 Ov 3)</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>). I share some heritage with the album too, mastered as it is by my buddy Shawn (aka Twerk) over at <a href=\"http://www.audibleoddities.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AudibleOddities</a>.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/DeepChord\" target=\"_blank\">DeepChord</a></strong>\n<em>Hash Bar Remnants, <a href=\"http://www.somarecords.com/shop/music/soma_310/\" target=\"_blank\">Part I</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.somarecords.com/shop/music/soma_319/\" target=\"_blank\">Part II</a></em>\nSoma\n\nRod Modell has got the knack for delivering a constant stream of floaty reverberating dub, and these installments are no exception. Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aeroc\" target=\"_blank\">Aeroc</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33468\" target=\"_blank\">R+B=?</a></em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Tejada\" target=\"_blank\">John Tejada</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/parabolas_dolp_cd\" target=\"_blank\">Parabolas</a>\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums. This one is the exception, a stellar atmospheric and minimal techno release, not to mention I just love having a Tejada vinyl with the ubiquitous Kompakt circles.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works. Fortunately idioms those... here broken... gLitsched... expectations frustrated... equal footing with the structure and form instead of attempting some kind of accompaniment... driven and poignant expositions. These tracks always make me check the iPod for what artist it is.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Logreybeam\" target=\"_blank\">Logreybeam</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.varia.ca/var002.html\" target=\"_blank\">Perhaps</a>\n</em>Les Enregistrements Variables\n\nWhen I listen, I keep wanting the hypnotic repetitions to evolve into a live jam of some sort, and I have under good authority that\'s the eventual goal of these tracks. Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle.

I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dog%2C+The\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Dog</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-dogma\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Dogma</a>\r\nLiber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-kult\" target=\"_blank\">Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\r\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-temple\" target=\"_blank\">Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\r\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-nox\" target=\"_blank\">Nox</a> (Book 3 Ov 3)</em>\r\nDust Science\r\n\r\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aeroc\" target=\"_blank\">Aeroc</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33468\" target=\"_blank\">R+B=?</a></em>\r\nGhostly\r\n\r\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Tejada\" target=\"_blank\">John Tejada</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/parabolas_dolp_cd\" target=\"_blank\">Parabolas</a>\r\n</em>Kompakt\r\n\r\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums.

Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\r\nPhantasma Disques\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\r\nTundra Dub\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-92','','','2012-01-10 23:33:41','2012-01-11 07:33:41','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-92/',0,'revision','',0),(610,2,'2012-01-10 23:33:48','2012-01-11 07:33:48','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

The constantly appearing layers are the most surprising and pleasing parts of these tracks, looping sound combinations you just don\'t expect, spanning a wide spectrum.

These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Menche\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Menche</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\r\nSub Rosa\r\n\r\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm.

These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/feral.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-591\" title=\"feral\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/feral-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Menche\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Menche</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm. I\'d certainly call it difficult listening, but more on the down-low engaging side than an all out aural assault, it even works as passive earpaper while I sysadmin. This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it! Looking forward to discovering more, and super glad I bumped into this release when I did.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.dogma_.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-598\" title=\"liber dogma\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.dogma_-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.kult_.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-600\" title=\"liber kult\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.kult_-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.temple.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-601\" title=\"liber temple\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.temple-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.nox_.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-611\" title=\"liber nox\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/l.nox_-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dog%2C+The\" target=\"_blank\">The Black Dog</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-dogma\" target=\"_blank\">Liber Dogma</a>\nLiber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-kult\" target=\"_blank\">Kult (Book 1 Ov 3)\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-temple\" target=\"_blank\">Temple (Book 2 Ov 3)\n</a>Liber <a href=\"http://duststoredigital.com/album/liber-nox\" target=\"_blank\">Nox</a> (Book 3 Ov 3)</em>\nDust Science\n\nIt was a great day when Ken Downie teamed up with Dust Science to resurrect The Black Dog in all its weird glory. It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/aeroc.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-587\" title=\"aeroc\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/aeroc-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aeroc\" target=\"_blank\">Aeroc</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=33468\" target=\"_blank\">R+B=?</a></em>\nGhostly\n\nGeoff White finally takes off his techno mantle and gives back some even greater tracks from his more smoothly downtempo project. I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/parabolas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-605\" title=\"parabolas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/parabolas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Tejada\" target=\"_blank\">John Tejada</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/parabolas_dolp_cd\" target=\"_blank\">Parabolas</a>\n</em>Kompakt\n\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums.

Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\n\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music?

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears.

It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\nself-released\n\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-588\" title=\"amen1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-589\" title=\"amen2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-607\" title=\"xwxwxwxwv\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-106','','','2012-01-11 00:13:47','2012-01-11 08:13:47','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-106/',0,'revision','',0),(613,2,'2012-01-10 23:45:30','2012-01-11 07:45:30','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

Even so, as it stands, I fondly call this melancholy collection \'shoegaze klezmer\' of a sort. My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-607\" title=\"xwxwxwxwv\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-588\" title=\"amen1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-589\" title=\"amen2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\r\nPhantasma Disques\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\r\nTundra Dub\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-95','','','2012-01-10 23:45:30','2012-01-11 07:45:30','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-95/',0,'revision','',0),(614,2,'2012-01-10 23:45:35','2012-01-11 07:45:35','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-96','','','2012-01-10 23:45:35','2012-01-11 07:45:35','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-96/',0,'revision','',0),(615,2,'2012-01-10 23:47:48','2012-01-11 07:47:48','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-97','','','2012-01-10 23:47:48','2012-01-11 07:47:48','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-97/',0,'revision','',0),(616,2,'2012-01-10 23:48:24','2012-01-11 07:48:24','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-98','','','2012-01-10 23:48:24','2012-01-11 07:48:24','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-98/',0,'revision','',0),(617,2,'2012-01-10 23:48:27','2012-01-11 07:48:27','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-99','','','2012-01-10 23:48:27','2012-01-11 07:48:27','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-99/',0,'revision','',0),(618,2,'2012-01-10 23:50:46','2012-01-11 07:50:46','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-100','','','2012-01-10 23:50:46','2012-01-11 07:50:46','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-100/',0,'revision','',0),(619,2,'2012-01-10 23:50:52','2012-01-11 07:50:52','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-101','','','2012-01-10 23:50:52','2012-01-11 07:50:52','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-101/',0,'revision','',0),(620,2,'2012-01-10 23:54:06','2012-01-11 07:54:06','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-102','','','2012-01-10 23:54:06','2012-01-11 07:54:06','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-102/',0,'revision','',0),(621,2,'2012-01-10 23:56:38','2012-01-11 07:56:38','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-607\" title=\"xwxwxwxwv\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-588\" title=\"amen1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-589\" title=\"amen2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\r\nPhantasma Disques\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\r\nTundra Dub\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-103','','','2012-01-10 23:56:38','2012-01-11 07:56:38','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-103/',0,'revision','',0),(622,2,'2012-01-10 23:58:54','2012-01-11 07:58:54','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

This artist is new to my ears this year, finally some semi-dense noise with a new sound to it!

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-104','','','2012-01-10 23:58:54','2012-01-11 07:58:54','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-104/',0,'revision','',0),(623,2,'2012-01-10 23:58:59','2012-01-11 07:58:59','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot. Maybe call it a \"compendium\"? No that sounds too boring. In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something on this list that is highly enjoyable.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds and atmospheres that flow between and around some masterfully arranged acoustic instrumentals (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How Did I Find These Sounds?</strong>\r\n\r\nYou\'re probably wondering, how in the fuck does this guy find such completely off the wall and yet totally awesome music? For one, I read <a href=\"http://thewire.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wire</a>, but I have to admit I haven\'t been reading my subscription for almost a year, being severely hooked on downloading and reading fiction on my kindle. To supplement my lack of attention to possibly the greatest music mag ever, I follow some blogs and hang out on IRC channels that keep me just as updated on the mysteries of the universe. Without fanfare, here\'s a few I can recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Basic Sounds</li>\r\n	<li>blah</li>\r\n</ul>','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-105','','','2012-01-10 23:58:59','2012-01-11 07:58:59','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/10/492-revision-105/',0,'revision','',0),(630,2,'2012-01-11 00:20:42','2012-01-11 08:20:42','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed. Although I don\'t cover any \"pop\" here, there\'s still a very wide range of music represented, listeners will be hard pressed to find at least something attractive on this list.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-112','','','2012-01-11 00:20:42','2012-01-11 08:20:42','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-112/',0,'revision','',0),(625,2,'2012-01-11 00:13:56','2012-01-11 08:13:56','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-107','','','2012-01-11 00:13:56','2012-01-11 08:13:56','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-107/',0,'revision','',0),(626,2,'2012-01-11 00:15:04','2012-01-11 08:15:04','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-108','','','2012-01-11 00:15:04','2012-01-11 08:15:04','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-108/',0,'revision','',0),(627,2,'2012-01-11 00:15:09','2012-01-11 08:15:09','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-109','','','2012-01-11 00:15:09','2012-01-11 08:15:09','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-109/',0,'revision','',0);

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-110','','','2012-01-11 00:16:23','2012-01-11 08:16:23','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-110/',0,'revision','',0),(629,2,'2012-01-11 00:16:30','2012-01-11 08:16:30','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger).

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-111','','','2012-01-11 00:16:30','2012-01-11 08:16:30','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-111/',0,'revision','',0),(631,2,'2012-01-11 00:21:19','2012-01-11 08:21:19','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-115','','','2012-01-11 00:22:58','2012-01-11 08:22:58','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-115/',0,'revision','',0),(634,2,'2012-01-11 00:23:53','2012-01-11 08:23:53','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-116','','','2012-01-11 00:23:53','2012-01-11 08:23:53','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-116/',0,'revision','',0),(635,2,'2012-01-11 00:23:57','2012-01-11 08:23:57','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-117','','','2012-01-11 00:23:57','2012-01-11 08:23:57','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-117/',0,'revision','',0),(636,2,'2012-01-11 00:24:14','2012-01-11 08:24:14','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability.

So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\").

It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\r\nPerlon\r\n\r\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\r\nNinja Tune\r\n\r\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness. I got the fantastic blue-fabric bound book version from Amoeba in LA, which is this amazing outlay of a miniature insect-like world created by Tessa Farmer (interestingly enough the very day I interviewed at <a href=\"http://www.buzz-media.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Buzz</a>).

My favorite parts of it are the weirder, more experimentally minded sounds, rhythms and ambience that flow between and around the masterfully arranged conversation between the instruments (all played by the same composer and arranger). This is a record I might expect to find as a solid Tzadik release with some extended soloing, and will hopefully be picked up beyond its homemade short-run life and get some play out as a real ensemble.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-606\" title=\"pianissimo possibile\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ppp-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Matthew+Mercer\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Mercer</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://matthewmercer.bandcamp.com/album/pianissimo-possibile\" target=\"_blank\">Pianissimo Possibile</a></em>\r\nself-released\r\n\r\nIf you listen to any amount of electro-acoustic music you\'re as painfully aware as I of the the glut of piano works.

Slightly ambient tracks with lighter drums sit neatly beside heavier beats that could easily be mixed into techno - in fact all two volumes provide a wealth of nice and long dub house tracks for the discerning mixologist (there is even a follow-up release of loops from these records).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/parabolas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-605\" title=\"parabolas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/parabolas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/John+Tejada\" target=\"_blank\">John Tejada</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/parabolas_dolp_cd\" target=\"_blank\">Parabolas</a>\r\n</em>Kompakt\r\n\r\nUsually when I see any remix on something done by Tejada, I get it, but have never been so much into the full albums.

I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-589\" title=\"amen2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-588\" title=\"amen1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-607\" title=\"xwxwxwxwv\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\r\nPhantasma Disques\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\r\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\r\nTundra Dub\r\n\r\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-118','','','2012-01-11 00:24:14','2012-01-11 08:24:14','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-118/',0,'revision','',0),(637,2,'2012-01-11 00:24:19','2012-01-11 08:24:19','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-119','','','2012-01-11 00:24:19','2012-01-11 08:24:19','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-119/',0,'revision','',0),(638,2,'2012-01-11 00:25:17','2012-01-11 08:25:17','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-120','','','2012-01-11 00:25:17','2012-01-11 08:25:17','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-120/',0,'revision','',0),(639,2,'2012-01-11 00:25:25','2012-01-11 08:25:25','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-121','','','2012-01-11 00:25:25','2012-01-11 08:25:25','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-121/',0,'revision','',0),(640,2,'2012-01-11 00:25:29','2012-01-11 08:25:29','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\r\n</em>Twisted\r\n\r\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\r\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\r\n</em>Schematic\r\n\r\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion.

So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-revision-122','','','2012-01-11 00:25:29','2012-01-11 08:25:29','',492,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/01/11/492-revision-122/',0,'revision','',0),(641,2,'2012-01-11 00:30:08','2012-01-11 08:30:08','Three years ago was the last time I did any kind of \"year\'s review\" of aural nourishment, and I sort of feel the need to do it again. <a title=\"My best 24 hours of music in 2008\" href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2009/01/05/my-best-24-hours-of-music-in-2008/\">Those 24 hours of music</a> are worth revisiting, and the following may not even count as a \"best of,\" but it is some of the best music I\'ve heard this year, and I listen to an awful lot.

In actuality this list is simply nothing more than a bunch of shit that goes on my iPod and ends up staying there for longer than it takes for me to get bored of it.\n\nAnd yeah, there\'s some strange shit indeed.

These EPs - on Brikha\'s new label, very worth following - provide a longing glimmer of those nights, a sliver of a view into that unending helical mass of filtered 4x4, but with the added flavor of a nicely wrought darker melodic display and just the right amount of unpretentious builds, expertly structured above thick analog basslines.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/feral.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-591\" title=\"feral\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/feral-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Daniel+Menche\" target=\"_blank\">Daniel Menche</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Feral/dp/B0053VK9IY/ref=tmm_msc_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Feral</a></em>\nSub Rosa\n\nReally getting into the subtle noise of this album, a stereophonic treat where tendrils of sound creep into formation, directed by equally interesting shifts in rhythm.

It\'s like a hole was in electronica and nobody ever knew it until new albums and remixes started showing up these past few years, and now here\'s a slew of new tracks (colored vinyl if you\'re one of the lucky ones!). The label page says the 12\"es are meant a continuation of the more darkly ambient <em>Music for Real Airports</em>, but they are definitively more straight-ahead techno. <em>Dogma</em>, on the other hand, is one of my favorite listens of the year, meant as a snapshot of what tBd does live, and the result is a beautifully organic evolving mass of electronic exploration and funky groovability. I never got into this band much pre-Plaid, but what I\'ve heard from that era doesn\'t touch the production values of what they\'re doing now.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-593\" title=\"the god particle\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/god_particle-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Shpongle\" target=\"_blank\">Shpongle</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://www.twistedmusic.com/shop/artists/shpongle/shpongle-the-god-particle-flac.html\" target=\"_blank\">The God Particle</a>\n</em>Twisted\n\nI can\'t deny my love of this band and when even a small two-track release appears I\'m all ears. So although some of their tracks get way too poppy for my taste, it\'s perfect that these are somewhat oldskool, and I especially love the Pink Floyd mimickery (not entirely unlike Download\'s \"Flight of the Luminous Insects\"). I guess there\'s a lot I like in tracks like these that remind me of my favorite times as a kid listening to the unfolding of albums like Dark Side of the Moon, and that can\'t be a bad thing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-590\" title=\"demissions\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/demissions-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Phoenecia\" target=\"_blank\">Phoenecia</a>\n</strong><em><a href=\"http://phoenecia.bandcamp.com/album/demissions\" target=\"_blank\">Demissions</a>\n</em>Schematic\n\nIt\'s really special when I find a record that caters more to darker electronica, the type of filtered analog sound with delicate beats and expansive reverberation atmospheres, the kind you\'ll often think \"man this would sound killer on a big system in the middle of the desert,\" complete with crunchy liquid percussion. It\'s not all beats though, there are some incredibly intense ambient sections that equally wrap your ears in haunting melodies from the other side of the chasm.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-603\" title=\"margaret dygas\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/margaret_dygas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Margaret+Dygas\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=30924\" target=\"_blank\">Margaret Dygas</a></em>\nPerlon\n\nThere is a playfulness in this album that compliments the regular cut-up and deep techno feel I usually get from the label. You know the drill: clean round synth harmonics contrast with crisp lines of shuffly drums and jazz-based samples nestled among the swelling and swaths of ululating drones... sounds typical, yes? Her arrangements are anything but; simple dissonant tonal contrasts propel the tunes beyond a boring four-by-four, and from out of nowhere you\'re sifted into head-bobbing syncopation that evolved from surprises you didn\'t even realize had happened.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-596\" title=\"isam1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-597\" title=\"isam2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/isam2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Amon+Tobin\" target=\"_blank\">Amon Tobin</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://bleep.com/index.php?page=release_details&amp;releaseid=29726\" target=\"_blank\">ISAM</a> (Control Over Nature)</em>\nNinja Tune\n\nSome regular fans were real disappointed, but the people I know who love it probably do so for all the same reasons i do: a poignant lack of sampling other works, intense abstract sound design, at times tableau-like, to-the-point sonic explorations, familiar filtered analog synth kaleidoscopes mixed with ample digital acrobatics and just the right touch of an eerily disturbing off-kilterness.

I like his house beats a lot, and the first Aeroc album was excellent, but this one takes all the elements of that goodness and fills in the rest with more of it, generously connecting with samples he uses in more upbeat affairs. Some of the best combinations of weird sounds and more traditional (acoustic) guitar licks out there, with plenty of groove to catch yer hook.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-589\" title=\"amen2\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen2-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-588\" title=\"amen1\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/amen1-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-607\" title=\"xwxwxwxwv\" src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/xwxwxwxwv-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/~%E2%96%B2%E2%80%A0%E2%96%B2~\" target=\"_blank\">~▲†▲~</a></strong>\n<a href=\"http://xwxwxwxwv.bandcamp.com/album/--2\" target=\"_blank\"> ~▲††▲~</a>\nPhantasma Disques\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/%E2%88%86Aimon\" target=\"_blank\">∆AIMON</a></strong>\n<em><a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-cdr-digital\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN</a> / <a href=\"http://tundradub.bandcamp.com/album/amen-remixes\" target=\"_blank\">AMEN Remixes</a></em>\nTundra Dub\n\nWhen you\'re actually searching through the underground for new things instead of just allowing them to pop up, you tend to run into some pretty awesomely strange shit (I mentioned the strange shit, right?). So first of all, I hate this genre title: Witch House (and I know you\'re thinking, \"RUN\'s house!\"). The alternatives are maybe not that better... \'Okkvlt\' is probably what works best for me, but there\'s also \'Zombie Rave\' or the more musicological but equally confusing term \'drag\'... not so easy to tell what they actually describe. To that end, I feel like these releases not only encapsulate a lot of what I\'ve heard from this style, but also what has gotten through to me more than other stuff. Orchestral, subtle folk, wide range of analog synth timbres, a rave element dialed down to icey glacial projections, plenty of noise and drone elements scattered throughout. Beyond style really, where a lot of genres meet up to melt together in an underworld of aural sublimity. I especially like the aspects of this genre that seem to be meant to keep it underground, for instance the indecipherable symbols and alternate typefaces for titling make it quite difficult for search engines, and a lot of the cover art are just bizarre and weirdly disturbing collages or suggestive imagery, which of course I find fascinating because the music echoes the same combinatory spirit. Highly contrasting, highly original stuff.\n\n&nbsp;','Listening in 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','492-autosave','','','2012-01-11 00:30:08','2012-01-11

Ensuing the expertise to make music that way, I departed into the wide unknown universe of DIY audio, which my wife lovingly calls \"the Rocket,\" I think because my studio resembles a half-built starship cockpit in deep regression.\n\nI posted this recently over at <a href=\"http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum\" target=\"_blank\">Muffwigglers</a>, thought I might throw it up here for everyone else to see. Everything listed here except for the first book were published after I started into the DIY world of audio, and after spending literally DAYS of searching and reading electronics tutorials and articles online, they have become my \'go-to\' stack for reference and inspiration.\n\n<strong>1.</strong> If you aren\'t familiar with <strong>Forrest Mims</strong>, get familiar with him. I just picked up Vol I. of his \"Engineer\'s Mini Notebook\" series, which is titled: <em>Timer, Op Amp &amp; Optoelectronic Circuits &amp; Projects</em>. It should have been titled: <em>The Building Blocks of Analog Modular Synthesis</em>, and I wish I had discovered it five years ago when I first started into building this stuff, cause it is indispensable. All the \"how do i build a 555 timer?\" and \"how do i correctly power an opamp?\" or \"what frequencies do i get if i change these resistors?\" questions that you search for hours on the Internet? It\'s all in here - there\'s even a chapter on photocouplers - aka \'varactors\' - which are used a lot for CV audio systems.\n\n2. Another specific project-oriented book but much more glossy and full of awesome examples and a DVD (which I haven\'t gotten around to watching yet, shame on me) is Handmade Electronic Music by Nicolas Collins. This one is specific to DIY audio hacking and electronic building, covering everything from building oscillators (different chips than the Mims books!) to circuit bending and experimental electronics.\n\n3. Make has started releasing awesome print publications (I have two of the Maker\'s Notebooks and love them). The one I\'ve found the most applicable and helpful to audio DIY is by Charles Platt and is one of the first: Make: Electronics. Simple, easy to understand tutorials on the foundations of... well, making stuff. With Electronics.\n\n4. Finally the most general of all of them but something that is a great learning resource for a wide range of electronic applications, by Michael Jay Geier, How to Diagnose and Fix Everything Electronic. The title doesn\'t lie. Every chapter is basically a Cliff\'s Notes on that particular subject or piece of equipment, summarizing how it works, what might go wrong with it or often does, and how to troubleshoot and fix it. It also includes quick introductions to fundamentals of physics and other things related to electronic parts and machines... and most importantly to us, a wonderful introduction to oscilloscopes and how to both choose and use them.','DIY Audio Resources: UNPLUGGED',0,'','inherit','open','open','','779-revision','','','2012-04-11 16:16:00','2012-04-11

the depths of a thrice-laid-off financial hole the technology industry bestowed upon me, I became fixated with actually building my own electronic instruments. Ensuing the expertise to make music that way, I departed into the wide unknown universe of DIY audio.\r\n\r\nThe first time I encountered a small, personal modular synthesizer was during a long gallery installation and collaborative work by <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Achim+Wollscheid\" target=\"_blank\">Achim Wollscheid</a> in Chicago (I also happened to have given him a ride to where he was going his first night there, and had rich conversations for the short time we were all together). I had my motley collection of contact-mics and sampling objects and looping pedals and probably what could be called a portable John Cage concert, which I used to improvise alongside Achim as he did the same over enormous loudspeakers placed in the ceiling of the large public space in this gallery (yes, I recorded). Anyway, someone else coming in to collaborate set up next to me on the balcony overlooking the space, revealing a portable <a href=\"http://www.doepfer.de/home_e.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Doepfer</a> A-100 suitcase model.\r\n\r\nThat\'s when it was over. That\'s the exact moment when a lot of things clicked, but apropos to our topic it was definitely the first time I felt the urging pang of modular desire, and barely realized it.\r\n\r\nFast forward ten years; as of 2012 I am the proud owner of a new disease known casually as <em>idiomatic modularsynthacropy</em>, or the addiction to building complex systems realized by modular synths. I think it\'s genetic, because this is an occupation my wife lovingly calls \"The Rocket\" due to my studio resembling a half-built starship cockpit (or at least the bar in one), and my brother being an actual rocket scientist.\r\n\r\nIt first manifested itself after Chicago \"event\" in the form of electronic tinkering and eventually the building of my own simple devices, made specifically to be used alongside other analog/acoustic instruments of improvisation. As it happened certain events also related to my unlucky job streak in the Internet business ended up affording me a barebones entry-level one 3U rack half-full beginner outfit: 8 \'eurorack\' style modules, the format Doepfer popularized, and in fact some are the very same kind I had first seen in that suitcase ten years ago.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum\" target=\"_blank\">Muffwigglers</a> is the forum for this disease, and there\'s even a forthcoming <a href=\"http://idreamofwires.org/\" target=\"_blank\">documentary</a>. A lot of the musicians I admire the most are modular users, and I\'m happy and fortunate to join their ranks along with a pretty decent wealth of electronic building knowledge under my belt in addition to the musicality. So I shared some of my accumulated knowledge recently on that forum, and wanted to post it here and add a bit of history.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nEverything listed here except for the first book were published after I started into the DIY world of audio, and after spending literally DAYS of searching and reading electronics tutorials and articles online, they have become my \'go-to\' stack for reference and inspiration.\r\n\r\n<strong>1.</strong> If you aren\'t familiar with <strong>Forrest Mims</strong>, get familiar with him. I just picked up Vol I. of his \"Engineer\'s Mini Notebook\" series, which is titled: <em>Timer, Op Amp &amp; Optoelectronic Circuits &amp; Projects</em>. It should have been titled: <em>The Building Blocks of Analog Modular Synthesis</em>, and I wish I had discovered it five years ago when I first started into building this stuff, cause it is indispensable. All the \"how do i build a 555 timer?\" and \"how do i correctly power an opamp?\" or \"what frequencies do i get if i change these resistors?\" questions that you search for hours on the Internet? It\'s all in here - there\'s even a chapter on photocouplers - aka \'varactors\' - which are used a lot for CV audio systems.\r\n\r\n2. Another specific project-oriented book but much more glossy and full of awesome examples and a DVD (which I haven\'t gotten around to watching yet, shame on me) is Handmade Electronic Music by Nicolas Collins. This one is specific to DIY audio hacking and electronic building, covering everything from building oscillators (different chips than the Mims books!) to circuit bending and experimental electronics.\r\n\r\n3. Make has started releasing awesome print publications (I have two of the Maker\'s Notebooks and love them). The one I\'ve found the most applicable and helpful to audio DIY is by Charles Platt and is one of the first: Make: Electronics. Simple, easy to understand tutorials on the foundations of... well, making stuff. With Electronics.\r\n\r\n4. Finally the most general of all of them but something that is a great learning resource for a wide range of electronic applications, by Michael Jay Geier, How to Diagnose and Fix Everything Electronic. The title doesn\'t lie. Every chapter is basically a Cliff\'s Notes on that particular subject or piece of equipment, summarizing how it works, what might go wrong with it or often does, and how to troubleshoot and fix it. It also includes quick introductions to fundamentals of physics and other things related to electronic parts and machines... and most importantly to us, a wonderful introduction to oscilloscopes and how to both choose and use them.\r\n\r\nAll these books together will probably cost you as much as a good VCO module! <img src=\"http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/images/smiles/icon_lol.gif\" alt=\"lol\" border=\"0\" /> But they are worth it, I highly recommend any of these to the DIY audio muffer.\r\n\r\n<hr />','DIY Audio: UNPLUGGED',0,'','publish','open','open','','diy-audio-unplugged','','','2012-04-11 17:36:58','2012-04-12 00:36:58','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=779',0,'post','',0),(768,2,'2012-03-14 15:19:58','2012-03-14 22:19:58','','Now Playing',0,'','inherit','open','open','','766-revision-2','','','2012-03-14 15:19:58','2012-03-14 22:19:58','',766,'http://sounding.com/blog/2012/03/14/766-revision-2/',0,'revision','',0),(800,2,'2012-04-23 09:43:23','2012-04-23 16:43:23','- Orbital ::: <em>In Sides</em> -\n- Dalglish ::: <em>Benacah Drann Deachd</em> -\n- Aus ::: <em>Lang</em> -\n- Tycho ::: <em>The Science of Patterns</em> -\n- Various Artists ::: <em>Elektronische Musik - Interkontinental</em> -','Now Playing: New-to-me Edition',0,'','publish','open','open','','now-playing-new-to-me-edition','','','2012-04-23 09:59:18','2012-04-23 16:59:18','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=800',0,'post','',0),(771,2,'2012-03-15 10:36:10','2012-03-15 17:36:10','- Farben ::: <em>Farben EP</em> -\r\n\r\n- Burnt Friedman ::: <em>Bokoboko</em> -\r\n\r\n- Susumu Yokota ::: <em>Dreamer</em> -\r\n\r\n- John Tejada &amp;

Ensuing the expertise to make music that way, I departed into the wide unknown universe of DIY audio.\n\nThe first time I encountered a small, personal modular synthesizer was during a long gallery installation and collaborative work by <a href=\"http://www.discogs.com/artist/Achim+Wollscheid\" target=\"_blank\">Achim Wollscheid</a> in Chicago (I also happened to have given him a ride to where he was going his first night there, and had rich conversations for the short time we were all together). I had my motley collection of contact-mics and sampling objects and looping pedals and probably what could be called a portable John Cage concert, which I used to improvise alongside Achim as he did the same over enormous loudspeakers placed in the ceiling of the large public space in this gallery. Anyway, someone else coming in to collaborate set up next to me: a portable Doepfer A-100 suitcase model.\n\nThat\'s when it was over. That\'s the exact moment when a lot of things clicked, but apropos to our topic it was definitely the first time I felt the urging pang of modular desire, and barely realized it.\n\nFast forward ten years; as of 2012 I am the proud owner of a new disease known casually as <em>idiomatic modularsynthacropy</em>, or the addiction to building complex systems realized by modular synths. I think it\'s genetic, because this is an occupation my wife lovingly calls \"The Rocket\" due to my studio resembling a half-built starship cockpit (or at least the bar in one), and my brother being an actual rocket scientist.\n\nIt first manifested from the Chicago \"event\" in the form of electronic tinkering and eventually the building of my own simple devices, made specifically to be used alongside other analog/acoustic instruments of improvisation. As it happened certain events also related to my unlucky job streak in the Internet business ended up affording me a barebones entry-level beginner outfit: what amounts to 8 \'eurorack\' style modules. In fact some are the very same kind I had first seen in that Doepfer ten years ago.\n\nThere\'s a <a href=\"http://www.muffwiggler.com/forum\" target=\"_blank\">forum</a> for this disease, and even a forthcoming <a href=\"http://idreamofwires.org/\" target=\"_blank\">documentary</a>, and I\'m proud to have finally reached this point with a wealth of electronic building knowledge under my belt. So I shared some of my accumulated knowledge recently on that forum, and wanted to share both it and a bit of the history.

I lived in the northern suburbs of DC, worked as a graveyard shift unix system administrator at a datacenter company called Digex, and hosted a radio show for two years while I studied in graduate school as a vocal student and specialist in experimental vocal music and opera performance. These were also the years I was heavily entrenched in the mid-Atlantic free improvisation and experimental avant-garde music and noise scene.\r\n\r\nAs an undergrad I hosted an early morning (6-9am) show on WUVT that was all about experimental music and jazz, something the station didn\'t have, and wanted to carry that tradition on in grad school. Naturally, it was at the U of Maryland that I hosted an experimental music radio show on WMUC, called \"Mother of Invention\".\r\n\r\nThe notebook flips between esoteric sysadmin notes, network architecture doodles, scribbled passwords and my radio playlists from the show. I will spare you the chicken scratch of Sun hardware, kerberos, RAID, nfs, mysql (yep, it existed back then) and T1 interface notes... let\'s focus on the playlists!\r\n\r\nBelow you\'ll find my complete playlists from this summer, from around July 2018 sometime into the fall, because like an idiot I was horrible at notating dates back then but some pages do have them. Originally I thought, hey! I should do each as a single blog post... but then I figured it\'s much better as a single reference, because social media is great at hiding sequentially updating things.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this blast from the past, and learn to enjoy some incredible music that is just as interesting and groundbreaking today as it was 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n--- July 27, 1998 ---\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Overture</li>\r\n 	<li>Heikki Nikula (Jarmo Sermilä) : Danza 4B</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Tomkins Square (3 parts)</li>\r\n 	<li>Jarmo Sermilä (Miklos Maros) : Manipulation Vbis</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Booty Dance</li>\r\n 	<li>Jerry Hunt : Transform (stream): monopole</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : I Love You So Much</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : As Momentums Go By</li>\r\n 	<li>Eve Beglarian : Disappearance Act</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Recitative: Trombone, Guitar, Harp &amp; Drums</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : So Noble and Kind He Seemed</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Clockworks</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Now and From Finale Part One</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Berliner Messes Kyrie</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Berliner Messes Gloria</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Erster Alleluiavers</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Zweiter Alleluiavers</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Veni Sancte Spiritus</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Introduction Giovanni\'s Dream</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Immitations</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Upshifting on an Upgrade</li>\r\n 	<li>Heikki Nikula (Markus Fagerudd) : Ingrepp I</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Spontaneous Navigation</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : \'Til the Cows Come Home</li>\r\n 	<li>Ellsworth Milburn : Menil Antiphons</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : T.

I lived in the northern suburbs of DC, worked as a graveyard shift unix system administrator at a datacenter company called Digex, and hosted a radio show for two years while I studied in graduate school as a vocal student and specialist in experimental vocal music and opera performance. These were also the years I was heavily entrenched in the mid-Atlantic free improvisation and experimental avant-garde music and noise scene.\r\n\r\nAs an undergrad I hosted an early morning (6-9am) show on WUVT that was all about experimental music and jazz, something the station didn\'t have, and wanted to carry that tradition on in grad school. Naturally, it was at the U of Maryland that I hosted an experimental music radio show on WMUC, called \"Mother of Invention\".\r\n\r\nThe notebook flips between esoteric sysadmin notes, network architecture doodles, scribbled passwords and my radio playlists from the show.

I lived in the northern suburbs of DC, worked as a graveyard shift unix system administrator at a datacenter company called Digex, and hosted a radio show for two years while I studied in graduate school as a vocal student and specialist in experimental vocal music and opera performance. These were also the years I was heavily entrenched in the mid-Atlantic free improvisation and experimental avant-garde music and noise scene.\r\n\r\nAs an undergrad I hosted an early morning (6-9am) show on WUVT that was all about experimental music and jazz, something the station didn\'t have, and wanted to carry that tradition on in grad school. Naturally, it was at the U of Maryland that I hosted an experimental music radio show on WMUC, called \"Mother of Invention\".\r\n\r\nThe notebook flips between esoteric sysadmin notes, network architecture doodles, scribbled passwords and my radio playlists from the show. I will spare you the chicken scratch of Sun hardware, kerberos, RAID, nfs, mysql (yep, it existed back then) and T1 interface notes... let\'s focus on the playlists!\r\n\r\nBelow you\'ll find my complete playlists from this summer, from around July 2018 sometime into the fall, because like an idiot I was horrible at notating dates back then but some pages do have them. Originally I thought, hey! I should do each as a single blog post... but then I figured it\'s much better as a single reference, because social media is great at hiding sequentially updating things.\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this blast from the past, and follow the links to enjoy some incredible music that is just as interesting and groundbreaking today as it was 20 years ago.\r\n\r\n--- July 27, 1998 ---\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Jim-Staley-Don-Giovanni/release/1513155\">Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni</a> : Overture</li>\r\n 	<li>Heikki Nikula (Jarmo Sermilä) : Danza 4B</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Tomkins Square (3 parts)</li>\r\n 	<li>Jarmo Sermilä (Miklos Maros) : Manipulation Vbis</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Booty Dance</li>\r\n 	<li>Jerry Hunt : Transform (stream): monopole</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : I Love You So Much</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : As Momentums Go By</li>\r\n 	<li>Eve Beglarian : Disappearance Act</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Recitative: Trombone, Guitar, Harp &amp; Drums</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : So Noble and Kind He Seemed</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Clockworks</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Now and From Finale Part One</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Berliner Messes Kyrie</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Berliner Messes Gloria</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Erster Alleluiavers</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Zweiter Alleluiavers</li>\r\n 	<li>Arvo Pärt : Veni Sancte Spiritus</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Introduction Giovanni\'s Dream</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Immitations</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Upshifting on an Upgrade</li>\r\n 	<li>Heikki Nikula (Markus Fagerudd) : Ingrepp I</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : Spontaneous Navigation</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : \'Til the Cows Come Home</li>\r\n 	<li>Ellsworth Milburn : Menil Antiphons</li>\r\n 	<li>Jim Staley\'s Don Giovanni : T.

remote workers had begun to retrograde to the point where even simple tolerance of the practice became a hot point. Leadership was known to stroll through offices and make comments about how they didn\'t see butts in seats, even frequenting some facilities on early morning Fridays just to scoff at the emptiness of the expansive \"open floor plans\" where interruptions and distractions were kept at a maximum. Human Resources went as far as to craft a strict remote worker policy, and included a very unpopular (and I think ultimately struck down) requirement of being in the office during \"banking hours\". Multiple times, as both a senior engineer and hiring manager, I hit roadblocks with remote employee hires - really good ones.&nbsp;In fact, working from home became a privilege that had to be approved at the executive level.</p>\n<p>Hard to believe I\'m talking about a startup in the 21st century, isn\'t it?</p>\n<p>In&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2018/03/23/remote_primer/\">Remote Worker: A Primer</a></em>&nbsp;I gave an introduction to my rich history as a remote employee and included some tips on how teams can make it successful. So as egregious as this all sounds, I would rather move beyond the ranting and finger-pointing. I want to talk about health.</p>\n<p>Soon after leaving said company, I happened to mention to a close friend on IRC about how my gastro-intestinal problems seemed to have subsided since I left. To my surprise, he mentioned exactly the same thing happening after a similar experience and then said a friend of his <em>also</em> made the same comment after leaving a stressful company situation. We were all victims of being in distress and not understanding why. Frankly, I thought it was tomato sauce.</p>\n<p>So yeah, stress is weird. You cannot always identify it, sometimes until it\'s too late, or when its sources have disappeared. It physically manifests in the weirdest places, so that you feel like you must be wrong in some other way... how could what seems like only an extreme mental condition cause such extreme physical distress?</p>\n<p>I first recognized this effect when a manager (not my supervisor) at different startup came up to me to rail about some random technology decision, I can\'t even remember what it was. The change was Hulk-like. I immediately flushed, I could feel the heat rising to my head, my ears start itching, eyes water. This person leaves after 5 minutes of ranting at me and I look down and I\'m literally covered in hives.</p>\n<p>I also used to have long, work-related nightmares featuring whatever employee or edict was brightest in my cranial heat-map at the time, and my feet would start intensely itching while I slept. The next morning I awoke covered in hives. This constant nagging of the itching would put me into weird fugue states where my mind was making strange abstract logic connections to my physical state, holding me in this kind of cognitive limbo where I wasn\'t deeply sleeping but nowhere near awake, and not dreaming.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>So I finally jumped.</p>\n<p>I decided to take control of my career. For too many years after the first \"DotCom Bubble Burst\", I felt like I was faking it. Good at what I set myself out to accomplish, but ultimately held back by one ceiling or another. Not always, but often enough, times felt rough and constantly churning under the whim of forces I could not control. I wanted to be an influencer and craft things, expand my learning, and contribute to the Earth.</p>\n<p>Innovating technology work on a small, highly senior, and highly intelligent <em>remote</em> engineering team was exactly what my body needed. For the first time in years, I am regularly getting a good night\'s sleep. Surprising considering the intensity of work and entire <em>estates</em> of new knowledge that I am now experiencing.</p>\n<p>It may not seem obvious, but I discovered part of my stress was actually anticipating the alarm going off in the morning. I don\'t need to make a train departure time for a 90-minute commute, the morning ritual is not rushed and haphazard, but I maintain it. I feel human waking up in the morning, and ready to conquer (no small amount of thanks to my spouse and partner in life, because our tiny house has now become my tiny office, too).</p>\n<p>Look, I barely have room in my psyche to handle the anxiety of my personal world, much less my professional one. When there is stress on both sides, they feed off each other, self-amplifying in a torrential loop, difficult to break. Getting to a place where I can be myself and completely kick ass at what I do gives me the strength to handle stressful situations and not be stressed about them.</p>\n<p>The chronic GI problems I used to have are no longer. I\'ve lost weight. I get hives only from real allergies, physical things I can avoid (although you can argue I now eschew the mental ones as well). My relationships are closer, and it is invigorating to feel more connected to my local community. I\'ve been energized to finish DIY builds and even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UbcfL9YA-Tg\">record new things</a>. Plus, I finally feel like I can make room - in time and thought - to write.</p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','The Shocking Before and After of Remoteness',0,'','inherit','closed','closed','','911-revision-v1','','','2018-09-07 15:41:59','2018-09-07 22:41:59','',911,'http://sounding.com/blog/2018/09/07/911-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1067,2,'2019-04-02 22:41:04','2019-04-03 05:41:04','<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1069,\"align\":\"center\",\"width\":576,\"height\":478} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/pickes-for-adam-1024x854.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1069\" width=\"576\" height=\"478\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>(on the </em><g class=\"gr_ gr_77 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace gr-progress\" id=\"77\" data-gr-id=\"77\"><em>occasion</em></g><em> of our meeting and bridge crossing)</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:preformatted -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Vinegar still rhythm<br>   Sounds in parallel<br>      Sticks shove and<br>         Pucker.<br><br>Twiddling stone across<br>   Steps to below regions<br>      Glass smoothly to <br>         Airwaves.<br><br>Pentatonic organum<br>   Slides the rails aside<br>      Bringing touches on<br>         Reedlings.<br><br>Air patterns float around<br>   Silent eyes and finds<br>      Lowly tones with<br>         Grains.<br><br>Fermented time brings<br>   Succulent and sprung<br>      Rocks melting or<br>         Clicking.<br><br>Repeat and distracted<br>   Silver round reflective<br>      Cover glimpse for<br>         Shakers.<br><br>Wooden spike and leather <br>   Salient table top runner<br>      Up down swideways for<br>         Dripping.<br><br>Finally ice in clacks <br>   Slides and carousels<br>      Rotations wax and be<br>         Poetic.<br></pre>\n<!-- /wp:preformatted -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(March, New York City, 2019)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Pickles for Adam',0,'','publish','open','open','','pickles-for-adam','','','2019-04-03 09:32:32','2019-04-03 16:32:32','',0,'https://sounding.com/blog/?p=1067',0,'post','',0),(942,2,'2018-11-25 15:23:53','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p>\n<strong>Save 60% OFF on MonsterInsights Pro &#8211; Limited Time Deal</strong></p>\n<p>Our annual sale is a great opportunity to unlock powerful MonsterInsights Pro features like Enhanced Ecommerce tracking (great for online stores), Form conversion tracking (great for business owners), Publishers Report (great for bloggers), Google AMP tracking, Banner Ads Tracking, Search Console Report, Custom Dimensions Reports (including author tracking, SEO score tracking, etc), and so much more.

So we settled in for a good bit of nothing we ever expected. Although I have never seen the Europera scores first hand, I have performed many other Cage pieces that revolve around the same concept: time brackets of performed material according to decisions arrived through chance operations. Many of his scores like this were performed simultaneously, so that not only did each individual composition interpenetrate with itself, it also did with the other piece.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Europeras are a culmination of this approach by Cage, and not only because they are among the last works he composed before his death in 1992. Chance procedures determine every aspect of the production, from costuming and scenery to blocking and the placement of arias selected from the standard repertoire. In the midst, selections from <em>Truckera</em> (a tape of 101 layered European opera fragments) were broadcast stereoscopically across loudspeakers above the audience, giving the sonic illusion a “truck of opera” was rattling by the performance and drowning everything out.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The entire work becomes a brilliant collage of sight, sound, dimension, and movement. There are entirely mind-bending <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxus\">Fluxus</a> moments of absurdity, subtle sequences of sublime beauty, and a good amount of unintended comedy.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The LA Phil performance mostly held true to Cage’s intent. There were dancers moving independently of both scrim- and prop-based scenery (also sequenced with chance operations), but also acting as stagehands and crew to move things around. Very seldom it starts to drift, as when these same dancers become engaged with the opera singers in their individual scenes.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have to hand it to the singers in this production. It is not hyperbole to state that seeing this performed is at the top of my bucket list. These folks were charged with non-traditional blocking, ignoring every other musical cue they hear around them while staying in-tune as possible, having to watch the large count-up clocks posted on each precipice of the stage, navigate indeterminately moving scenery and other actors, all while performing a fully committed aria wearing costuming and performing blocking both separately derived by chance operations and completely unrelated to the entire way they were taught to interpret an aria.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some did this better than others. One of the more successful sang “<g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">Oh</g> du, <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">mein</g> holder Abendstern” from Wagner’s <em>Tannhäuser</em>, outfitted in full astronaut garb (minus helmet), the entire time both lying and moving around a hospital bed, while any number of other arias, scene changes, and lighting queues happened around him. I found it masterfully performed against a magnificent bed of chaos.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many of the singers’ performances were like this. As was the orchestra. There was an incredible amount of commitment in this show that is absolutely vital to Cage’s music. The entire ensemble - from stage crew and props to performers and designers - dialed in on this aspect of performing Cage and it comes through.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lighting queues and design were scored completely separately as well, often focussing on the audience, into the ceiling of the warehouse, across the back of the building behind the open stage area. Scrim backgrounds, some looking quite ancient, dropped at various elevations, frequently covering an entire “scene” behind it due to the chance operations involved. Sometimes individually numbered squares onstage were illuminated, amorphous areas of color appeared, and more than once a strange ladder descended made entirely of what appeared to be fluorescent rods.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sopranos galloping on life-size fake horses carried by dancers, a baritone singing (Mozart?) while preparing a steak on a hot plate with chopped vegetables, a tenor in drag performing what I think was from Rake’s Progress (Stravinsky), the Toreador Song (from Carmen) staged to a commercial being filmed for hair products. Some scenes had no singing at all, like the baritone who sunbathed in 70s garb for what seemed like an eternity before he finally got up and sang a short aria. Or the girl backward in a running belt vibration machine drinking a coke with a straw in a full Wizard-of-Oz Dorothy outfit (complete with ruby slippers) and maybe sang, but maybe didn’t. Or the soprano auctioning off small statues to members of the orchestra, complete with gavel banging. Yoga and Queen of the Night, I think it was?<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Except in one rare case where a tuba belted out Flight of the Valkyries, the orchestral parts were not as immediately recognizable as the arias, but equally enjoyable in the mix of it all. I especially loved interjections from percussion, like sudden cybals and tympani. The effect of this differentiated musical tissue was like an extended meditation on simultaneous sound against a landscape that was constantly in motion.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall, <em>Europera 1</em> was more recognizable for me and felt like it breathed with long sequences, wonderful moments of silence where the HVAC in the huge studio warehouse took its solos, combinations of the orchestra that did not feel at all chance-derived, and I felt drawn in the entire time. <em>Europera 2</em> felt more compressed, more frenetic, maybe more immediately interesting but definitely more chaotic. Nevertheless, it ultimately wasn’t as memorable as the first, and yet felt more voluminous and energetic. Even the chance-derived synopses (related to nothing) reflect this telescopic pattern:<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>1<br></p><p>He falls deeply in love with a beautiful <g class=\"gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"18\" data-gr-id=\"18\">streetsinger</g> who staggers into the hut.

Whether in musical style or approach to theatre, the materials themselves are often not his. Musical scores evolved into graphic iconography or instruction governed by brackets of time and/or duration. Written pieces were amalgamations, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesostic\">mesostics</a> “written through” other authors’ work, or more “cut-up” style constructions of various texts.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It applied to his philosophies, too. He is known to take bits and pieces of Eastern practice and weave their concepts into his worldview and compositional process. Concepts like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayan\">Huayan Buddhist</a> “interpenetration” of all things were slightly bent by Cage, who found them useful for composing, but maybe slightly ignoring (or denying) any inherent interconnectedness.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Such synergy is often attributed to improvisation, like a jazz combo. On the contrary, Cage was very much about the <em>accidental</em> interpenetration of elements by downplaying any relationship importance between them at all. The idea of “playing off each other” as if playing jazz was not allowed, simply because it wasn’t scored that way.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These were simply concurrent events that coincided in layers against each other, necessarily connected by nothing but the experience, indeterminate and interpenetrating. It seems to imply chaos, and that is precisely how my wife described the LA Phil west coast premiere of <em>Europeras 1 &amp; 2</em> to me afterward: “too much going on for your brain to comprehend” and “the weirdest thing you’ve taken me to yet.”<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now that’s saying something! We’ve participated in Long Beach SoundWalk multiple years, we’ve seen some outrageous installations and concerts. Even <em><a href=\"http://craque.net\">my</a></em><a href=\"http://craque.net\"> music</a> is pretty damn strange. Whether or not this actually hit the tip of the Weirdometer, there was one thing we agreed upon: <em>nothing</em> was happening, and <em>everything</em> was happening.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My wife and I have never been to a movie studio lot, so it was a new experience just arriving and finding our way back through the closely stacked identical warehouses to Studio 23. The Sunday matinee crowd fascinated us. We guessed the throng held Cage fans, opera fans, music students, season ticket pass holders and supporters of LA Phil, friends of the cast and orchestra, and even scattered fashionistas.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Inside was a simple proscenium stage configuration, the audience rising up and back, fly loft and everything built into this huge soundstage. On each side of the main stage were three columns of <g class=\"gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"12\" data-gr-id=\"12\">orchestra</g>, with most major instruments represented at least once. The stage itself was an 8x8 grid, marked with numbers 1-64 to represent hexagrams of the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching\">I Ching</a></em>, which itself is used to drive the chance operations required for creating the performance based on Cage’s score. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The distinction of <em>1 &amp; 2</em> is a programmatic one, they have always been performed together as a 90 + <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">45 minute</g> show. So we settled in for a good bit of nothing we ever expected.

Even when it\'s a prescribed style, a lot of preparation goes into the Superb DJ Set.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What makes the Superb Set?

(materials)</li><li><em>The </em><strong><em>spectrum</em></strong><em> of choice.</em> What tracks make sense with what other tracks?

(structure)</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regardless of medium (disc or no disc), DJs accomplish each step in different ways depending on who they are. It always involves the collection strategies, stylistic tastes, requirements of the event, attention to form and/or/not structure, personal goals (musical or professional), and the audience itself. The DJ may be a completely free improviser, an experimental sound artist, a wedding MC, a techno junkie, an EDM opportunist, a desert party space explorer, a masterful breakbeat juggler, or an underground house magician. I believe they all include some version of each of these categories.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ready for this? <em>The same tenets apply to building a Successful Technology Team.</em> Compare:<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li><strong>Homework.</strong> Who do I want or need to include on this team?</li><li><strong>Spectrum.</strong> Who has the right balance of talent that makes sense on this team?</li><li><strong>Environment.</strong> What are the requirements of the business?</li><li><strong>Flow.</strong> How does the team interact, collaborate, and ultimately deliver?</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just like the diverse history of DJs and music, tech teams span a vast range of expertise and function, not to mention approaches to organization. I’m talking about everything from day-to-day (or should I say, sprint-to-sprint) Agile teams and purpose-built developer tiger teams to “T-shaped engineers” on multi-functional operations teams and necessarily heterogeneous IT departments. Each of these individuals are like specific tracks on a record, the pieces of music themselves, expertly selected and set into sympathetic vibration and choreographing their own results. The audience is not only the customer but also product managers and project coordinators (not unlike event producers and organizers), and many other parts of the technology business.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, where the DJ and the Technology Leader (let’s call them a ‘TL’) really intersect is <em>diversity in construction</em> and <em>release of control</em>. For example, the homework of the DJ might be crate digging or further exploration of known things online. The TL has the homework of digging into the talent pool and recognizing what they want or need on the team. Both are fraught with mistakes and hidden gems. The DJ selects a diverse spectrum of tracks to mix, while the TL should espouse diversity among teammates mixed together. The DJ’s venue is analogous to the TL’s workplace, what is needed not by the music/team but what shapes the work they do. Flow from track to track and section to section is no different from the team’s ongoing efforts to work together, match each others’ strengths, and support each others’ weaknesses.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The resultant similarity between a Superb Set and a Successful Tech Team is not really a tenet as much as it is the desired effect: the DJ/TL steps back and lets the music/team combine and take control. Once the DJ has prepared their set, when it is in full swing and engaging whatever audience, specific control is lost. External forces - like the energy of the dance floor, requests made by listeners, anomalies and failures in the sound system itself, or even just a scratch in the record - indeterminately affect the materials, structure, and flow. The Superb DJ is ready for these challenges, to help guide both the rules under which they operate and the engagement of participants involved to a harmonious and fulfilling goal.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If that’s not like building and running a great team, I don’t know what is. We deal daily with interruptions and unknowns in running software on distributed networks. Humans are humans, and like scratches in records, they can cause mild-to-severe issues within the team. Requests made by product (or other) managers can interrupt, company events will necessarily intertwine, and unforeseen losses of momentum and energy can mean nobody is dancing anymore.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes as a DJ I will buy a record because I like the sound or the album art or even just the composer’s name, only to find that its BPM doesn’t match anything I own, or its sound is too harsh to really use in a public setting. It is why it is crucial not to only consider one of the four tenets, but to carry the desire for something great as a thread through each phase of the approach. Intuition is good, but also including close evaluation and clear decision making is better. In that sense, careful listening and observation is as important in musical interpretation as it is managing diverse human personalities and lifting them be successful technology leaders themselves. It might be true that everyone is a DJ because they can just “press play”, but the Superb Set - and the Successful Tech Team - is the reachable dream.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Successful Tech Teams and the Superb DJ Set',0,'','publish','open','open','','successful-tech-teams-and-the-superb-dj-set','','','2018-11-29 16:51:47','2018-11-30 00:51:47','',0,'http://sounding.com/blog/?p=944',0,'post','',0),(945,2,'2018-11-29 16:27:05','2018-11-30 00:27:05','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The term <em>disc jockey</em> was first coined in 1935, referring of course to the phonograph discs that had become popular for recorded music.

When people ask me if electronic music or singing is my \"hobby\", I am wincing inside. So a question often on my mind is: <em>how does the intuition I have when performing and composing music connect with the work I do as a technologist?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some musicological background might help. One concept in learning how to improvise (jazz or otherwise) is that you have developed an <em>intuition</em> built around internalizing the materials and form of the piece (or genre) - like scales, chord changes, or rhythm structures. This is different from the more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain\">lizard-brainy</a> concept of <em>instinct</em>. Think about a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues\">blues progression</a>, the foundation of music you hear every day, everywhere. You know <em>intuitively</em> the chord progression and timing is \"right\", even so much that anomalies and departures come across as emotionally significant. The rest is pop history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you, <em>homo sapiens</em>, do not have this chord sequence <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">pre-programed</g>&nbsp;in your DNA, it isn\'t something that is instinctual. By the same token, great technology leaders develop good <em>intuition</em> (expertise over hundreds of interviews) when hiring engineers but never rely on <em>instinct</em> (oh I just have a good \"gut feeling\"). The best DBAs have an <em>intuitive</em> understanding of their platform (you want to do X, but did you think of Y+Z?), but there\'s nothing <em>instinctual</em> about it.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is not a stretch, then, to recognize that intuition in improvised music can be directly compared to how Allspaw writes about the \"mental map\" that engineers develop. They each have their own subjective view on relevant (but overlapping) parts of the system and are challenged when relating each substrate to theirs. For instance, a phenomenon known as \"fundamental common-ground breakdown\" (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/0471739448.ch6\">Woods &amp; Klein: Common&nbsp;Ground&nbsp;and&nbsp;Coordination&nbsp;in&nbsp;Joint&nbsp;Activity</a>) happens when what I describe as <em>intuitions</em> (accumulated individual learnings about the system) are assumed knowledge among participants, good or bad. Part of the game is learning how to harmonize these separate threads of experience, avoiding costly <em>coordination surprise</em> and re-synchronization... and trust me, I have been in plenty of rehearsals and narrowly saved performances that fit this description!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The important point here is that a system becomes more complex as it grows dimensions, shrinking the capacity of any one person to comprehend the whole thing. Therefore we rely on shared and discovered knowledge to fully grok these fascinating systems. Take any ensemble of musicians:&nbsp;as it grows in membership, individuals gradually lose the ability to contain its myriad relationships in their mental map, so coordination and integration become a matter of listening and rehearsal experience (both modes of <em>communication</em>). Oh and it characterizes the music, too. Building intuition about how to play a part in an opera is much different than in a <a href=\"https://commavoices.bandcamp.com/\">free improv vocal trio</a>. Orchestrating ten thousand <g class=\"gr_ gr_305 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"305\" data-gr-id=\"305\">linux</g> containers in a cloud provider doesn\'t compare to managing two rows of server racks at the <g class=\"gr_ gr_859 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"859\" data-gr-id=\"859\">datacenter</g> downtown.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Technologists grapple with the task of building and sharing intuitions about a system because understanding an <em>entire</em> system contributes to what we know about making it more resilient. Communication is key in either musical or engineering teams, collaboration on understanding the whole is no exception. Our mental maps should be adaptable to constant updates, and practices like <a href=\"https://principlesofchaos.org/\">Chaos Engineering</a> that make discoveries in complex system behavior are supported by this kind of cross-pollination and proliferation of our combined understanding.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A quote from Allspaw\'s article highlights it well:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Maybe the process of designing a chaos experiment is just as valuable as the actual performance of the experiment.</p><cite>- John Allspaw, Recalibrating Mental Models through Design of Chaos Experiments</cite></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The use of the term \"performance\" is apt. We\'re familiar with this concept: practice makes perfect. Taken further, the <em>experience</em> of practice is necessary such that the result is merely an <em>extension</em> of practice. It takes meticulous work to understand a piece of music to the level of having an intuition about how it operates, and the same goes for building experimentation that challenges what you think you know about complex software. The results of the \"performance\" can be enhanced by a focus on understanding the system\'s design and <em>steady state</em> (i.e. nominal condition), what we would call the <em>language</em> of the musical work. It is as if the performance of the event naturally evolves from learnings gained preparing for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Imagine you are a jazz musician, you have gone through years of studying scales and changes and charts and recordings of a particular artist, and have built a capability for understanding how the language of their music works. One evening at a local club, your dreams are fulfilled, you\'re in the audience and invited up for a set with them. You <em>intuitively</em> know how this person plays their music, as it has been a guide for your own. But when you\'re jamming together, they do something indeterminately that informs your intuition in a way you would have never discovered yourself. Not only has the process of designing your inevitable collaboration been valuable to understand what you thought you needed to know to play like your biggest influence, but it also served as the basis for learning something new and unexpected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether it is free improvisation or interpreting a through-composed piece of music (and everything in between), there is a certain amount of experience and training informing the performance. Eventually, when we\'ve practiced enough, the music itself steps out of the way and intuition takes over. I think this is where my musical performance connection with technology starts: once you understand the fundamentals of the system, let the presentation of the system get out of the way, and you\'re in a better place to evolve your mental map and gain further intuition through disciplines like Chaos Engineering.<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/would-chaos-any-othername-casey-rosenthal/\"></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Musical Intuition meet Technology and Chaos',0,'','publish','open','open','','musical-intuition-meet-technology-and-chaos','','','2019-02-11 14:48:49','2019-02-11 22:48:49','',0,'https://sounding.com/blog/?p=950',0,'post','',0),(951,2,'2018-12-26 12:38:38','2018-12-26 20:38:38','Over the years I\'ve spent a great deal of time on the intuition side of music making.\r\n\r\nIntuition is not magic.

In music, it includes many things: composition, instrumentation, preparation, production, performance, presentation, recording, distribution, consumption, listening... just to name a few.

One example that comes to mind is electronic music and the way that computer technology has driven the ability of the individual to control the entire lifecycle. A laptop can be an entire production studio and publication platform. The tools a musician uses to do this have become sufficiently abstracted that an entire world of expertise is no longer required.

The nature of distribution and consumption in a heavily networked world means that cross-pollination increases exponentially, and soon we are overcome with such a huge variety of musical output and genre-bending that it becomes impossible to navigate. Even in terms of instrumentation and recording, details become abstracted and devices do a lot of the hard work under the hood.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I liken this to the discipline of distributed computer systems not only because music has gone hand-in-hand with the development of the computer, but also that they share this phenomenon of \'dependent abstraction\'<g class=\"gr_ gr_303 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace\" id=\"303\" data-gr-id=\"303\">.</g></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let\'s get concrete.

How? <em>What is this photo?</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So once I start looking into this, I learn about the accompanying videos. The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mM90X-9m_Zc\">Laibach one</a> featured on the Mute website (which cleverly includes a shot of the <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/Various-CagedUncaged-A-RockExperimental-Homage-To-John-Cage/release/1959476\">Cramps Caged/Uncaged homage</a> from 2000) is a kind of short silent film. I imagine many (if not all) of the other videos will be similar. So it\'s telling that they refer to it as a \"cover\" and use words like \"interpolation\" to describe this collection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The terminology now makes sense to me. These are not performances of the original score, but takes on Cage\'s own expansion of the idea that it could be performed as anything, at any time, for any duration (like the versions of <strong>0\'00\'\'</strong> from <a href=\"http://rosewhitemusic.com/cage/texts/SongBooks.html\"><strong>Song Books</strong></a>). Presenting an alternative action during the \"silence\" of a representative version of <strong>4\'33\'\'</strong> is not so much a reading of the score as it is an interpenetration of events. Which is fine, even enjoyable. Nevertheless, the very idea of <strong>4\'33\'\'</strong> in the popular eye is surrounded <g class=\"gr_ gr_81 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"81\" data-gr-id=\"81\">in jokes</g> and doubt, so it is ironically funny to think that a recording imparts the same sort of wonder that a live experience of it does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Spoiler: it doesn\'t.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to witnessing it several times, I performed <strong>4\'33\'\'</strong> at my undergraduate recital (on classical guitar!). Let me tell you... it is <em>much</em> more than just the sounds around you and what leaks in. It is a visceral experience that isn\'t captured in a recording, where the very best of intentions can only pay tribute to the surreal actuality of sitting there, enduring the seconds as nothing happens. The tension in the audience is very VERY real. Sometimes funny, sometimes raucous, but regardless the performer must stay focussed. There is simply nothing that gives the work the heft that Mute describes without experiencing it firsthand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a kind of funny postscript... when I was near the end of my time in grad school, where I rigorously studied voice and Cage\'s music, I was asked to participate in a production of <strong>Theater Piece</strong>, a work of simultaneous but unrelated events. Somehow, <em>CF Peters</em> (the sole publishers of Cage\'s scores) heard of this production, that I was involved, and assuming me responsible tracked me down to demand royalties be paid for staging the piece. Except - for once - I wasn\'t staging it, I was merely performing, and explained as much. I wonder... had I said we weren\'t <em>performing</em> <strong>Theater Piece</strong>, only doing a <em>cover</em> of it, if they would have left us alone. ;)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9171805-no-such-thing-as-silence\">No Such Thing As Silence: John Cage\'s 4\'33\'\'</a> by Kyle Gann if you\'re curious about the mythology around this composition.

That there is a final state determined <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">by products</g> of the experimentation, and he thought that his (and others\') music <em>was</em> complete when performed. There was no \"final state\" that was decided as a result of an experiment either succeeding or <g class=\"gr_ gr_165 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"165\" data-gr-id=\"165\">failing,</g> if it was itself called <em>experimental</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cage revised this view, however. He began embracing the term and actually ended up preferring it. The reason for this is the way he evolved to think about the context of sound. At the beginning of the decade, he experienced an anechoic chamber (an \"echoless\" room) and the non-presence of total silence, because he could hear both high and low sounds -- explained to him by the engineer as his nervous system in operation and blood circulating, respectively. Whether or not that is physiologically probable, he had the now famous revelation that it is impossible to remove sound completely. <em>4\'33\'\'</em> and an entire philosophy about the nature of sound and silence in music was not far behind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To him then, the moniker <em>experimental</em> came to mean that which is undiscovered, because even if a piece of music requires certain sounds, environmental sounds are impossible to predict. This <em>experimental music</em> isn\'t about the search for failure or success, but an experience of discovery, where questions become more interesting than answers. When applied to composition, each performance of a musical work is always new and different due to its context and sonic environment. Indeed, it is impossible to know ahead of time any structure of the interpenetrating sounds both intentional and not, themselves independent and unique (whether or not they are consonant). It is in fact in a total state of chaos, each and every time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When complex systems run, they do so at the hand of indeterminacy and randomness. There certainly is a \"steady state\", but it is continuously in need of verification. Just like Cage observing that no performance of a musical work is a repeat, <g class=\"gr_ gr_132 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"132\" data-gr-id=\"132\">the nature</g> (structure and form) of distributed systems we operate cannot in truth be predicted with any kind of regularity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So while it is useful to be very specific in defining and running our Chaos experiments, the nature of what we\'re doing is more about asking questions and making discoveries, not testing for answers we already think we know or think we can guess. The \"breaking things in production\" mantra implies we are interested in failure when what we\'re really interested in is what was determined and what questions arose, good or bad.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><em>Appendix</em></strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are a couple of PDFs taken from Cage\'s writing that highlight his viewpoint on the subject of \"experimental music\" as a title of what he did.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://craque.net/my/shared/Cage-experimental_music_55.pdf\">Experimental Music: Doctrine</a> (1955) ::: This article, there titled <em>Experimental Music</em>, first appeared in <em>The Score</em> and <em>I.

An easy tweetable answer! Except that it\'s loaded with questions and assumptions. Instead, what I will talk about here are <em>technology decisions</em>.

This isn\'t an ideal situation, and in some cases, impractical because it feels like a policing. In fact, it might sound a little selfish to think that SRE needs the ability to say \"yay\" or \"nay\" to a decision. If you think that feels slightly siloed, you\'d be right. I prefer working with all vested parties to come up with a solution that fits the problem, not just make blind leaps of faith on a particular platform. Flexibility and cooperative evaluation work really really well, believe it or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In my experience, it takes a <em>minimum</em> of six months for a team to work up a brand new (to them) technology or platform and have it be supportable in production. Even then, if the software team building it won\'t be permanently oncall for it (which is something else I believe), they should at least be on the hook for a <em>minimum</em> of six months further as the kinks are worked out. This seems fairly straightforward for something like a development framework or a particular platform specific to operating the software system in question. For example, adopting Redis as a DBRE-supported platform in production. There are clear reasons why the software needs this kind of ultraspeedy k/v store, and building up widespread support in SRE for it means other software teams benefit. That is a highly opinionated decision and one that\'s fairly easy to make especially because it\'s free!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But is it? In contrast, what happens when you need to fulfill the needs of infrastructure? This is where Operations tires really hit the road. This doesn\'t mean it\'s a siloed decision, for example introspecting the system is as important to reliability engineering as it is to the folks developing the software. The Redis example above shows how technology decisions become a crucial part of the collaboration among everyone involved building your product, whether it be dev or sec or ops or everything in-between. However, it doesn\'t quite reflect the reality of infrastructure requirements, particularly tooling that supports the needs of reliability. <em>\"We need monitoring and we need it yesterday!\"</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, I posit: There is no \"Build or Buy\". <strong>There is only Buy.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1012,\"align\":\"left\",\"width\":393,\"height\":394} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft is-resized\"><img src=\"https://sounding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/basic_vco-2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1012\" width=\"393\" height=\"394\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I build electronic instruments. My product is the music I make, and one the central philosophies in my approach to improvisation and performance is the concept of \"original sound\". What music does a plucked cactus make when amplified, or how can a mercury tilt-switch and photoresistor create sound from electrons? The top picture here is of a breadboard, a prototype of a device that will eventually drive something called a \"Voltage Controlled Oscillator\", or VCO. To the left is a photo of a professionally designed, tested, and built VCO. I have no need to design and build a VCO, even though fun, it is a distraction - both in time and money - from my main purpose: the creation of a new kind of analog synthesizer controller. I\'d rather buy the VCO and the accompanying support of the experts who not only built it but are passionate about its success. Then I can focus resources on my creativity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The technology decision to be made is heavily informed by what kinds of resources you want to spend on it. Building a platform in-house, using your own people, is sometimes only feasible with very large companies that have the ability to staff for this, and often have custom circumstances. It\'s not hard to notice that a few very successful software platforms come out of organizations in this position. These teams also must deal with all the infrastructure costs, maintenance, reliability, and complex aggregations of data and transports. These problems have indeed been solved many times over by third party SaaS/PaaS/IaaS solutions, but sometimes the amount of customization required demands it. Or the development of these systems may be so clearly aligned with the company objectives that it is a non-question (e.g. Netflix pioneering Chaos Engineering or Google producing Borg/Kubernetes).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These days, such cases are the exceptions. Most of us are with companies where this luxury and concentration of engineering ability aren\'t present. It may make a ton more sense to choose an expert in the field, whose company mission is <em>specifically</em> to provide this need. The argument that Ops Is A Cost Center is underlined<g class=\"gr_ gr_95 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"95\" data-gr-id=\"95\">, </g>because the focus should really be on the product. <em>\"We\'re good enough we can run a custom log aggregation stack at the same time we\'re developing this completely dependent but orthogonally related product\"</em> is probably an approach that should be questioned, unless of course you are prepared to <em>buy</em> those resources through hiring and operational expenses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Either way, you\'re building something. Recall the decision to choose Redis, and how long it took to enable that system in production. The same will apply to any in-house platform or tooling. Nevertheless, it\'s a tradeoff. To buy resources for building in-house or <g class=\"gr_ gr_124 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"124\" data-gr-id=\"124\">buy</g> a third party SaaS, each have their own layers of complexity, complication, and frustration. Yep, it might be fun to build, but is embarking on such a project <em>really</em> the right choice for the team and the product?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like many in Ops, I once considered the \"Elastic Search / Logstash / Kabana\" (aka ELK) stack for datacenter log aggregation. All its various pieces are a fun complex thing to put together, and it\'s an extremely useful resource for gathering and displaying events. All these pieces are freely available things, but our SRE teams were already pretty busy with the task of running our own product and <em>other</em> custom bits of infrastructure. It would take at least a single SRE\'s full time and attention to keep the stack running across multiple server farms of 10,000+ nodes. Not to mention training and documentation for others. Maintained, tested, resilience-hardened, budgeted, the list goes on. I\'m definitely going to be \"buying\" a lot here, and it\'s a messy looking BOM. ELK\'s competitors at the time ranged from fairly entry-level cloud-based SaaS to \"Enterprise\" packages, but one vendor, in particular, would be a great solution. Was there a cost and the administrative toil of negotiating a contract and keeping a vendor relationship going? Yep. It\'s also a single invoice, takes much less time from the SRE team to manage, and is much simpler to integrate with the farm.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would you rather focus on building the instrumentation into your software and have a team of external experts guide, consult, and ultimately provide the intelligence platform to which they have dedicated their careers? Or would you rather split focus and build your own customizations into the infrastructure? It\'s not black and white, either. One method may outweigh the other depending on whether you\'re bare-metal or in the cloud. There may be security reasons to do one over the other. As the software product matures, these needs may blur. What needs to be bought may be simple and small or complex and large, and grow in either direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So let\'s be clear: a third party platform isn\'t automatically \"more expensive\" than creating an equally performant service or fulfill a particular infrastructure reliability need in-house.

She does so by taking us back to the foundations of modern opera in Italy, adeptly adopting the term \'<g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">camerata</g>\' from the Florentine Camerata example she uses, applying it next to social circles of painters and artists in later <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">centuries,</g> and then to teams creating software. She considers how our mental models evolve and how common ground is reached through the shared experience of a varicolored team from all sorts of different backgrounds, ultimately making the team more powerful. \"We are developing whole new ways of being human together\" she states, and to me, that\'s nowhere more clear than with multi-disciplinary collaboration.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <em>CS / Math / Music</em> crossover is clearly one I have encountered a lot, from early on. While I was studying voice and music technology in undergrad, I vividly remember walking with a good friend in downtown Blacksburg, and her saying to me \"I could never major in music, there\'s too much math.\" I used to laugh at this because there\'s really only as much math as that you wish to encounter. Want to dive into tempered tuning and Kepler\'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth#Pitch_ratio\">mathematical ratios for perfect fifths</a>? Go for it. But you know, these days I look at that statement through different lenses. Yes, there is just enough math!

They had decided to move into software engineering after art school and said my talk, which combines theories and ideas in music with those of observing and operating huge distributed databases, was inspiring. They had been trying to reconcile their internal \'artistic identity and self\' with their passion for coding, and I had opened their eyes to a new way of considering it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will never forget this.

There\'s no getting away from the audience, however small. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage\">John Cage</a> preached throughout his career as an avant-garde composer: <em>listeners are participants</em>. Every performance is something new because there are different people in different places every single time.

To the left is a photo of a professionally designed, tested, and built VCO. I have no need to design and build a VCO, even though fun, it is a distraction - both in time and money - from my main purpose: the creation of a new kind of analog synthesizer controller. I\'d rather buy the VCO and the accompanying support of the experts who not only built it but are passionate about its success. Then I can focus resources on my creativity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The technology decision to be made is heavily informed by what kinds of resources you want to spend on it. Building a platform in-house, using your own people, is sometimes only feasible with very large companies that have the ability to staff for this, and often have custom circumstances. It\'s not hard to notice that a few very successful software platforms come out of organizations in this position. These teams also must deal with all the infrastructure costs, maintenance, reliability, and complex aggregations of data and transports. These problems have indeed been solved many times over by third party SaaS/PaaS/IaaS solutions, but sometimes the amount of customization required demands it. Or the development of these systems may be so clearly aligned with the company objectives that it is a non-question (e.g. Netflix pioneering Chaos Engineering or Google producing Borg/Kubernetes).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These days, such cases are the exceptions. Most of us are with companies where this luxury and concentration of engineering ability aren\'t present. It may make a ton more sense to choose an expert in the field, whose company mission is <em>specifically</em> to provide this need. The argument that Ops Is A Cost Center is underlined<g class=\"gr_ gr_95 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"95\" data-gr-id=\"95\">, </g>because the focus should really be on the product. <em>\"We\'re good enough we can run a custom log aggregation stack at the same time we\'re developing this completely dependent but orthogonally related product\"</em> is probably an approach that should be questioned, unless of course you are prepared to <em>buy</em> those resources through hiring and operational expenses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Either way, you\'re building something. Recall the decision to choose Redis, and how long it took to enable that system in production. The same will apply to any in-house platform or tooling. Nevertheless, it\'s a tradeoff. To buy resources for building in-house or <g class=\"gr_ gr_124 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del\" id=\"124\" data-gr-id=\"124\">buy</g> a third party SaaS, each have their own layers of complexity, complication, and frustration. Yep, it might be fun to build, but is embarking on such a project <em>really</em> the right choice for the team and the product?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like many in Ops, I once considered the \"Elastic Search / Logstash / Kabana\" (aka ELK) stack for datacenter log aggregation. All its various pieces are a fun complex thing to put together, and it\'s an extremely useful resource for gathering and displaying events. All these pieces are freely available things, but our SRE teams were already pretty busy with the task of running our own product and <em>other</em> custom bits of infrastructure. It would take at least a single SRE\'s full time and attention to keep the stack running across multiple server farms of 10,000+ nodes. Not to mention training and documentation for others. Maintained, tested, resilience-hardened, budgeted, the list goes on. I\'m definitely going to be \"buying\" a lot here, and it\'s a messy looking BOM. ELK\'s competitors at the time ranged from fairly entry-level cloud-based SaaS to \"Enterprise\" packages, but one vendor, in particular, would be a great solution. Was there a cost and the administrative toil of negotiating a contract and keeping a vendor relationship going? Yep. It\'s also a single invoice, takes much less time from the SRE team to manage, and is much simpler to integrate with the farm.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would you rather focus on building the instrumentation into your software and have a team of external experts guide, consult, and ultimately provide the intelligence platform to which they have dedicated their careers? Or would you rather split focus and build your own customizations into the infrastructure? It\'s not black and white, either. One method may outweigh the other depending on whether you\'re bare-metal or in the cloud. There may be security reasons to do one over the other. As the software product matures, these needs may blur. What needs to be bought may be simple and small or complex and large, and grow in either direction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So let\'s be clear: a third party platform isn\'t automatically \"more expensive\" than creating an equally performant service or fulfill a particular infrastructure reliability need in-house. Do the research and compare, make the investment that makes the most sense for your team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don\'t be fooled, though.

Plenty of <strong>humans</strong> are musicians, and <em><strong>all</strong></em> of us are listening, even those who cannot hear. In my travels through datacenters and software, I have come across musicians like myself who have not only done double-duty with their computer science and creative lives but also relate and interweave them. If they\'re like me, they cannot break them apart. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of us. We all have different stories, came into the worlds of music and of technology from different angles and different backgrounds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I\'ll hazard a guess that when you think about the words <strong>music</strong> and <strong>technology</strong> together, it\'s likely you\'re thinking about <strong>music technology</strong>. This isn\'t surprising, a great deal of music technology surrounds the production, performance, and recording of music. Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI), studio recording, guitar pedals, analog control voltage synthesizers, DJ decks, Ableton Live, Max/MSP, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joeerl\">Joe Armstrong</a> running Erlang on <a href=\"https://sonic-pi.net/\">Sonic Pi</a>... the list goes on and gets fractally esoteric.

But humans share such an indisputably organic relationship with music and musical training that I knew I wasn\'t just some crazy person, the connection was there and it was real. How else do I have the job I have now? This pushed me to want to find others that share my views on the close relationship music has with software and operational reliability.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chloecondon\">Chloe Condon</a> (Dev Advocate at Microsoft), a self-described recovering musical theatre actress.

Her <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/n1U1rcThnzw\">Mozart could\'ve been an Engineer</a></em> talk correlates music theory and counterpoint to building software. She emphasizes the similarities of <em>pattern recognition</em> between the two disciplines, especially as it relates to learning. Preparing a new piece or constructing a score interpretation is 100% relatable to the software engineer learning a new language or building in a new framework. I especially love how she emphasizes the importance of having different types of minds together in one group, in other words, don\'t be afraid to hire a music major.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These folks that are trained in synchronizing common ground through the experience of playing in musical ensembles carry a distinct advantage.

It’s heady, as metaphysics and social philosophy tend to be, but one takeaway I like is that ‘experience’ necessarily includes the <em>novelty</em> of ideas and actions. That means <em>newness</em>.

However, on that day of Cognitive Systems workshops, I learned that there was actually an entire <em>discipline</em> built around the indeterminacy that I loved to see in nature and society and the things we build and operate. Suddenly, I knew the <em>BwO</em> better. The uncertainty of the world practically describes it, so I began to wonder how it relates and connects things outside of metaphysics.

The <em>thing</em> has limited, if any, control over what its <em>BwO</em> looks like.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For my purposes, it resembles inherent Chaos. For instance, it is not that outside agents cause this of their own unpredictable accord (“our users/jr.engineers give us this already”), but that combinations of <em>all</em> factors create unpredictable outputs at the boundaries of competence. There’s just no way of knowing, but there are potential possibilities.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the <em>thing</em> is a complex socio-technical system, we already know that diversity and collaboration help understand it well beyond its organs.

It does not exist outside of its practice, it is <em>beyond</em> just musicians and any score. The music itself is not a combination of elements and not more than the sum of its parts, indeed that implies a linear relationship and a known quantity!

So keep in mind that these examples are not so much about the metaphysical concept of the <em>Body without Organs</em>, but rather how I\'ve recognized its qualities in other disciplines, outside of theory.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The Cognitive Systems workshop introduced me to a wonderful talk by another researcher in Resilience Engineering, <a href=\"https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/richard-cook/\">Dr. Richard Cook</a> (Adaptive Capacity Labs), titled <em>Bone is Resilience</em>. He shows how adaptive capacity among interoperable body systems continuously regenerate and strengthen bone as the result of a complex system. It involves everything from diet and vitamin intake to blood circulation and bone marrow operation, not to mention each of <em>those</em> systems, in turn, all cooperate with <em>other</em> systems that would seem to have nothing to do with bone growth. These are all quite literal organs. What’s <em>not</em> codified as an organ, or otherwise described as one, is the result of what happens when bones build robustness along lines of stress, heal fractures, or even just <em>grow</em> in a world dominated by gravity. Bone system adaptation along the axis of time is descriptive of a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li><li>Another example that comes to mind is the notion that work-as-planned is <em>never</em> work-in-practice. Rather than say “all models are false”, maybe it makes more sense that all models aren’t models unless they contain a <em>BwO</em>, or the <em>real work</em> of the system, its potentials. Which of course requires the existence of a ‘non-static model’ to differentiate it from the system-as-designed (i.e. work-as-planned). If the system-as-designed is the organs, elements of putting these organ-ic systems into practice comprise the non-static model, which includes its <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li><li>A crucial lesson from the workshop is the idea that what we’re studying when we analyze why a complex system fails is the same domain as what happens when it succeeds. <a href=\"http://hopcoach.net/what-about-bob/\">Bob Edwards</a> (Human &amp; Organizational Performance Coach) taught and talked about this, putting it beautifully: “To understand failure, study success. The same things that are there when failure happens are the same things that are there when success happens.” Including all potentials on the same stratum, success or failure, is descriptive of a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li><li>Finally, improvisational music is squarely in this realm. The obvious answer is, well of course it is! Mental models and Bailey\'s \"practice of practice\" are quintessentially <em>BwO</em> domains. They are defined by the novelty of their creation in each individual, and when combined with other individuals create a much greater understanding of the whole. The ongoing collaborative understanding of a complex system as it changes and adapts is descriptive of a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Practical Postulating Virtual Potentials<br></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I’ve been describing in these examples that include <em>virtual potentials</em> (i.e. <em>indeterminacy</em> or <em>unknown unknowns</em>) is described by Deleuze as a \'Healthy BwO\'. They are non-static planes of existence, fluid and open to reframing and adaptation. Not necessarily bad, not necessarily good. Just all bits of the same virtual potential, creating new knowledge.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The goals behind adaptive approaches to managing complexity consider this. A central workshop motif was our everchanging, adaptive world. My interests over the years have resonated with this, I am fascinated with discovery and change, and realize a lot of my art - visual and sonic - reflects that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My current work interests follow the same themes, most certainly <a href=\"https://principlesofchaos.org/\">Chaos Engineering</a>. Its goal is not to cause damage or create chaos, but to employ careful experimentation to examine what <a href=\"https://complexity.osu.edu/people/woods.2\">Dr. David Woods</a> calls the system’s <em>graceful extensibility</em>, and how it is exposed during the loss of integrity at an operational boundary. These distributed systems we build quickly corporate a <em>Body without Organs</em> almost merely by their variable nature alone, any observation is one in the past, we cannot know the state of the system. As they begin operating at boundaries of competence, they encounter novel modes of potential, whether it be an outage or a surprise efficiency. Chaos Engineering experimentation really becomes a <em>window</em> into the <em>BwO</em>, not an element of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The Equality of Immanence</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you think that this <em>thing</em> has both good and bad stuff in it, and they’re both as variable as the other, it comes pretty close to another feature of Deleuze called the ‘Plane of Immanence’. That sounds lofty, but it’s the opposite. It simply means one thing: life, death, consciousness, spirituality, all of it is equal in the same metaphysical flux. None of it ‘transcends’ any other bit of it. This struck me as similar to the ‘new view’ of safety espoused by <a href=\"http://sidneydekker.com/\">Sydney Dekker</a>, where there is no such thing as a <em>transcending</em> root cause explanation like human error. The alternative is what Deleuze might call a ‘Cancerous BwO’: petrified regeneration of static patterns, recursive and stuck in linearity. I would certainly say the ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys\">5 Whys</a>’ and ‘Root Cause Analysis’ are elements of a pathologically cancerous <em>Body without Organs</em>.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <em>Healthy BwO</em> concept, even as an allegory, makes sense in our adaptive world. The way to survive an environment that is constantly changing isn’t to create barriers and simplifications, but to embrace its Immanence and <em>maneuver</em> complexity with diverse perspectives instead of fighting it, because virtual potentials will happen whether we like them or not.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most memorable lesson I got from the workshop is that there <em>is</em> a simple answer to complexity: Let it happen.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Meta Workshop Jam',0,'','publish','open','open','','meta-workshop-jam','','\nhttps://sounding.com/blog/2019/03/21/musicirtechus/','2019-08-15 20:09:10','2019-08-16 03:09:10','',0,'https://sounding.com/blog/?p=1116',0,'post','',0),(1113,2,'2019-08-01 11:23:37','2019-08-01 18:23:37','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week I had the extreme pleasure of attending a three-day workshop on Safety Systems. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Notes from the Cognitive System',0,'','inherit','closed','closed','','1094-revision-v1','','','2019-08-01 11:23:37','2019-08-01 18:23:37','',1094,'https://sounding.com/blog/2019/08/01/1094-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1114,2,'2019-08-01 11:24:31','2019-08-01 18:24:31','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Recently I have come to realize that my particular version of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">imposter syndrome</a> about working in tech - individual contributor and manager alike - might be unfounded.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Early in my history in this business, I wasn\'t thinking about it as a career.

I seek out things, I follow threads of interest, I pay attention to collaborators and studio players and remixers to find other things that might interest me. I am a crate digger because I love discovery.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So naturally, my predilection while I work is to random play 3200 albums I\'ve collected on disk or ripped from my thousands of CDs.

It didn\'t seem like a new concept to me, this larger complexity. Even still, it turns out that Operations people became triggered by the word \"DevOps\".

I remember agreeing how some uncategorizable <em>thing</em> exists on both sides as an outcome, where a result far greater than merely the sum of its parts occurs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Music isn’t just the combination of the instruments, it’s the way in which humans push their operation forward through time both creating and adapting to the music and each other simultaneously. I feel like adaptive capacity in a resilient system works much the same way, and this workshop helped confirm my thinking. Here are some reflections about how it forged new connections between my Ops mind and my Musical one (which are <a href=\"https://sounding.com/blog/2019/03/21/musicirtechus/\">not that far apart</a> already).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>What is this <em>thing</em>?<br></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve learned that I have latched onto bits of information when discovering. Something will catch my eye or ear and make a little meerkat synapse in my brain stand up and look around and go, “hold up, what’s that?” It’s probably the element of my psyche that drives my vinyl record store diving. I am not sure I would have never become the <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7659.Paul_Bowles\">Paul Bowles</a> fanatic I am without first hearing “Tea in the Sahara” by The Police in the \'80s. Never would have come across the thinking of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze\">Gilles Deleuze</a> while studying music if I didn’t ask myself “why is this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Plateaux_(record_label)\">record label</a> called <em>Mille Plateaux</em>?”<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus\">A Thousand Plateaus</a></em> (1980) is a tome Deleuze penned with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Guattari\">Félix Guattari</a> that discusses artists, musicians, psychoanalysts, historians and all sorts of other things having to do with asking questions about reality. It’s heady, as metaphysics and social philosophy tend to be, but one takeaway I like is that ‘experience’ necessarily includes the <em>novelty</em> of ideas and actions. That means <em>newness</em>. Discovery! An expansion of knowledge, an unbounded dimension of insight, an openness to adapt, embracing the unknown and the unexpected.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, later that workshop evening, as a bunch of Human Factors geeks had drinks in a hipster place with fake wood stoves, I learned of someone who has done recent research on cognition in jazz improvisation. Wonderfully adjacent to my own interests, and I may have never heard about it under other circumstances. I love these tendrils of discovery, and it’s those veins of potentials that Deleuze is suggesting belong to a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Real Work<br></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regardless of whether Deleuze speaks of art, philosophy, or science, his view emphasizes that we are the most interested in how something <em>works</em>. In fact <em>real work</em> - the things you and I do every day to complete our job titles - cannot be separated from the <em>surprises</em> and <em>adjustments</em> that lie therein. Any number of virtual possibilities potentially describe our engagement with a complex system beyond its components, beyond its recognizable organs and their describable arrangement.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m no philosophy student, so an evaluation of metaphysics isn’t my goal here. Nevertheless, when I perceive new angles of thinking about things in different ways, I jump on them as opportunities to discover something about a topic through following a different, sometimes oddball, perspective of that topic. Again, the latch-and-tendril effect. In the spirit of <em>Mille Plateaux</em>, I will proceed dutifully <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism\">Postmodern</a> and arbitrarily decontextualize a bit I can latch onto!<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have already mentioned the <em>Body without Organs</em> (BwO). It is a strange concept, and not one that I immediately grokked (the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_without_organs\">wikipedia entry</a> may help). However, on that day of Cognitive Systems workshops, I learned that there was actually an entire <em>discipline</em> built around the indeterminacy that I loved to see in nature and society and the things we build and operate. Suddenly, I knew the <em>BwO</em> better. The uncertainty of the world practically describes it, so I began to wonder how it relates and connects things outside of metaphysics. Like musical improvisation and resilience engineering.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The <em>Non-Thing</em>?<br></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <em>BwO</em> is one way to think about the <em>thingness</em> of complex systems beyond their components, where effects and outcomes may be more interesting than systemic organ function. That sounds like the opposite of a <em>thing</em>, but that’s the point; it’s not the <em>thing</em>, but <em>beyond</em> the thing. The <em>thing</em> has limited, if any, control over what its <em>BwO</em> looks like.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For my purposes, it resembles inherent Chaos. For instance, it is not that outside agents cause this of their own unpredictable accord (“our users/jr.engineers give us this already”), but that combinations of <em>all</em> factors create unpredictable outputs at the boundaries of competence. There’s just no way of knowing, but there are potential possibilities.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the <em>thing</em> is a complex socio-technical system, we already know that diversity and collaboration help understand it well beyond its organs. More expansive than just a “whole that is greater than the sum of its parts”. The result of the complex system is a condition that only exists in real-time, and is ultimately empirical and practical in application; it simply cannot exist contained within a theory or design.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is “the practice of practice” that guitarist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Bailey_(guitarist)\">Derek Bailey</a> ascribes to the music in his book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341932.Improvisation\">Improvisation</a>. It does not exist outside of its practice, it is <em>beyond</em> just musicians and any score. The music itself is not a combination of elements and not more than the sum of its parts, indeed that implies a linear relationship and a known quantity! Instead, it is expansive along the various potential faultlines of novelty and experience set before it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>!Theory<br></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My mentor and musicology professor in grad school would always pronounce that word like “thhheeeaoryy” and we’d laugh and go about our day putting screws between piano strings. So keep in mind that these examples are not so much about the metaphysical concept of the <em>Body without Organs</em>, but rather how I\'ve recognized its qualities in other disciplines, outside of theory.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The Cognitive Systems workshop introduced me to a wonderful talk by another researcher in Resilience Engineering, <a href=\"https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/richard-cook/\">Dr. Richard Cook</a> (Adaptive Capacity Labs), titled <em>Bone is Resilience</em>. He shows how adaptive capacity among interoperable body systems continuously regenerate and strengthen bone as the result of a complex system. It involves everything from diet and vitamin intake to blood circulation and bone marrow operation, not to mention each of <em>those</em> systems, in turn, all cooperate with <em>other</em> systems that would seem to have nothing to do with bone growth. These are all quite literal organs. What’s <em>not</em> codified as an organ, or otherwise described as one, is the result of what happens when bones build robustness along lines of stress, heal fractures, or even just <em>grow</em> in a world dominated by gravity. Bone system adaptation along the axis of time is descriptive of a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li><li>Another example that comes to mind is the notion that work-as-planned is <em>never</em> work-in-practice. Rather than say “all models are false”, maybe it makes more sense that all models aren’t models unless they contain a <em>BwO</em>, or the <em>real work</em> of the system, its potentials. Which of course requires the existence of a ‘non-static model’ to differentiate it from the system-as-designed (i.e. work-as-planned). If the system-as-designed is the organs, elements of putting these organ-ic systems into practice comprise the non-static model, which includes its <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li><li>A crucial lesson from the workshop is the idea that what we’re studying when we analyze why a complex system fails is the same domain as what happens when it succeeds. <a href=\"http://hopcoach.net/what-about-bob/\">Bob Edwards</a> (Human &amp; Organizational Performance Coach) taught and talked about this, putting it beautifully: “To understand failure, study success. The same things that are there when failure happens are the same things that are there when success happens.” Including all potentials on the same stratum, success or failure, is descriptive of a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li><li>Finally, improvisational music is squarely in this realm. The obvious answer is, well of course it is! Mental models and Bailey\'s \"practice of practice\" are quintessentially <em>BwO</em> domains. They are defined by the novelty of their creation in each individual, and when combined with other individuals create a much greater understanding of the whole. The ongoing collaborative understanding of a complex system as it changes and adapts is descriptive of a <em>Body without Organs</em>.</li></ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Practical Postulating Virtual Potentials<br></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I’ve been describing in these examples that include <em>virtual potentials</em> (i.e. <em>indeterminacy</em> or <em>unknown unknowns</em>) is described by Deleuze as a \'Healthy BwO\'. They are non-static planes of existence, fluid and open to reframing and adaptation. Not necessarily bad, not necessarily good. Just all bits of the same virtual potential, creating new knowledge.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The goals behind adaptive approaches to managing complexity consider this. A central workshop motif was our everchanging, adaptive world. My interests over the years have resonated with this, I am fascinated with discovery and change, and realize a lot of my art - visual and sonic - reflects that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My current work interests follow the same themes, most certainly <a href=\"https://principlesofchaos.org/\">Chaos Engineering</a>. Its goal is not to cause damage or create chaos, but to employ careful experimentation to examine what <a href=\"https://complexity.osu.edu/people/woods.2\">Dr. David Woods</a> calls the system’s <em>graceful extensibility</em>, and how it is exposed during the loss of integrity at an operational boundary. These distributed systems we build quickly corporate a <em>Body without Organs</em> almost merely by their variable nature alone, any observation is one in the past, we cannot know the state of the system. As they begin operating at boundaries of competence, they encounter novel modes of potential, whether it be an outage or a surprise efficiency. Chaos Engineering experimentation really becomes a <em>window</em> into the <em>BwO</em>, not an element of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>The Equality of Immanence</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you think that this <em>thing</em> has both good and bad stuff in it, and they’re both as variable as the other, it comes pretty close to another feature of Deleuze called the ‘Plane of Immanence’. That sounds lofty, but it’s the opposite. It simply means one thing: life, death, consciousness, spirituality, all of it is equal in the same metaphysical flux. None of it ‘transcends’ any other bit of it. This struck me as similar to the ‘new view’ of safety espoused by <a href=\"http://sidneydekker.com/\">Sydney Dekker</a>, where there is no such thing as a <em>transcending</em> root cause explanation like human error. The alternative is what Deleuze might call a ‘Cancerous BwO’: petrified regeneration of static patterns, recursive and stuck in linearity. I would certainly say the ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys\">5 Whys</a>’ and ‘Root Cause Analysis’ are elements of a pathologically cancerous <em>Body without Organs</em>.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <em>Healthy BwO</em> concept, even as an allegory, makes sense in our adaptive world. The way to survive an environment that is constantly changing isn’t to create barriers and simplifications, but to embrace its Immanence and <em>maneuver</em> complexity with diverse perspectives instead of fighting it, because virtual potentials will happen whether we like them or not.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most memorable lesson I got from the workshop is that there <em>is</em> a simple answer to complexity: Let it happen.<br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->','Meta Workshop

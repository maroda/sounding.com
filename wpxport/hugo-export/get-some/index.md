## Non-DRM Distributors (digital and otherwise)

  * <a href="http://www.boomkat.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bookmat</a> is not only the home of the dubby Modern Love dance label, but also houses a huge selection of experimental / electronic label releases, physical and digital alike.
  * [eMusic][1]
  * <a href="http://downtownmusicgallery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Downtown Music Gallery</a> in NYC now has a decent web presence and a way to order securely by email, and is probably one of the best alternative record stores I&#8217;ve ever visited (multiple times!).
  * [Bleep][2] &#8211; for all intents and purposes, Bleep picked up where EFA left off, distributing not only Warp artists but a great many other European labels; in fact WarpMart has now merged into Bleep.
  * [Kompakt][3] is not only a great label with many sublabels, they also do a lot of European distribution as well, and is a great place for getting vinyl.
  * [Forced Exposure][4] is my go-to for experimental releases on vinyl, though they carry CDs as well. No digital distribution, but they do carry Buddha Machines!
  * [Hard Wax][5]
  * [Juno][6]

## Sound (and other) Art

  * [UbuWeb][7] features free downloads of many well known fringe artists, including both sound and video.
  * [SoundTransit][8] is a collaborative, online community dedicated to field recording and phonography.

## Free Samples and Loops

  * [The Freesound Project][9] aims to create a huge collaborative database of audio snippets, samples, recordings, bleeps, etc. released under the Creative Commons Sampling Plus License.
  * [Soundsnap][10] is another free sound sample and loop library.
  * [OLPC][11] (One Laptop Per Child) features &#8220;Over 10GB of FREE Samples â€“ for The Children of the World&#8221;

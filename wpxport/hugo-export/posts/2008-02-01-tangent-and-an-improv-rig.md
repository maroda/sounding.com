The synth used for my **Feb 8** show at <a href="http://dangerouscurve.org" target="_blank">Dangerous Curve</a>, incorporated in my <a href="http://gallery.mac.com/maroda#100008" target="_blank">live electro-acoustic rig</a>. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Craque/+videos/4325725" target="_blank">last.fm video of the show</a> that actually has pretty decent sound!

What you see below is my homebuilt synth (three square wave oscillators fed through dual 2-pole lowpass filters, each metal box has an engage switch, tone control, and cutoff frequency) fed through (or not) a Boss AW-3 dynamic wah filter, an acoustic guitar contact microphone fed through (or not) an <a href="http://audiobulb.com" target="_blank">Audiobulb</a> **FZ-Bulb**, a pocket shortwave radio, several found objects (near and in the tin can), and behind that a Line6 DL4, Electrix Repeater, Alesis Quadraverb and Behringer Xenyx 1622 mixer. Oh and the white box on the front is a small music box, plus there&#8217;s a second one without a cover underneath the tin polka-dotted ratchet.

One reason I use hardware is because I am drawn to the **tangibility** of performing music, of relaying mind and body energy through my relationship with the instrument at hand. I can dive directly into the creation of experience as the gear becomes extensions for expression.

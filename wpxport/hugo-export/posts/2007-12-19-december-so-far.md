Well I know you could just go through my Last.fm listening or whatever, but it doesn&#8217;t represent everything. So this isn&#8217;t a best-of by any stretch, just a viewfinder into what I&#8217;ve been listening to the past 3 weeks. They&#8217;re loosely grouped by categoryâ€¦ I&#8217;ll let the reader decide how to categorize them. </p>

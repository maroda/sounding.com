some recent releases on digital i&#8217;m enjoying. some brand new, some not so new, but they keep me coming back: </p> 

  * **Kim Cascone** has a special way of writing music like the sound of crumpling paper, here stratified by field recordings on <a target="_blank" href="http://excentrica.org/musica/exc009/">The Astrum Argentum</a>. I&#8217;m especially drawn to the sounds in this recording, especially how conscious-close they are to escaping all original form; the experienced listener expertly removes themselves from reality with kim&#8217;s music. 

  * Two recent items of the **Xymogen** imprint are very enjoyable: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xynthetic.com/xsn013.html">Progress Report</a> is the definition of a great compilation, with brilliance in each example of wide ranging styles and approaches. **Mercury Effect** also recently impressed with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xynthetic.com/xsn010.html">Ataxia</a>, a crunchrubbery fractured hike down a trail of broken beats. 

  * Boulder, CO&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://tenandtracer.net">Ten and Tracer</a> has two recent large ominous blobs of fine output, one on **Archipel** : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.archipel.cc/releases/mpÂ¾3">L-Msaria B-Lglass</a>, and another on **Zymogen** : <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zymogen.net/releases/zym012/">Baker&#8217;s Blood</a>. Here is a sound with a special way of slicing its incongruence into your expectations, equal parts textured noise, equal parts thumping bass beat madness, equal parts bizarre. 

  * From mates **Audiobulb** the spring begat an **Ultre** album wrapped as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.audiobulb.com/ab-shop.htm">All The Darkness Has Gone To Details</a>, a work of collage and contrast that has grown into my ear like a mercuric fuzz, creaking at the edges of fragile electro-acoustic balance. 

Some vinyl jibber jabber coming soon, I figure this is as good of a place as any to express my views of some great music.</p>

I&#8217;m very happy to announce the release of a project I did this summer called _Tekuchesti_ (a transliteration of _текучести_, which is a Russian word meaning &#8220;fluidity&#8221;), a piece in shuffle time for listeners and improvisers.

<a href="http://constanta-label.ru/%5Bconst008%5D_craque_-_tekuchesti.zip" target="_blank">Download the entire work</a>, and _remember to listen on shuffle_. Weird request you say? Read the liner notes below for more detail&#8230;

Please also visit the <a href="http://constanta-label.ru/product_8.htm" target="_blank">release page at Constanta</a> and check out the other artists on this new boutique netlabel, which features some unique approaches to the microsound/glitch/experimental/drone genres; beauty through subtlety and simplicity. I personally enjoy op.cit.&#8217;s and To4ka.Dna&#8217;s most recent releases.

Here is my description and instructions for performance (these notes are also available in Russian through Constanta):

> In tectonics, slices of the earth can be reduced bit by bit to their constituents, all in motion consistent with the plate. Below these fractured mantle pieces is a thick world of geology: elemental chemical reactions, intense temperature changes, varying strata of materials. There may be violent upheaval or capitulation of forces, or just still and silent veins of metal. If we could travel as a massless beings through the earth to the antipodal, each layer of Hell opens not a Dantean dream, but a surreal tour of random pockets describing the origin of the solar system.
> 
> _Tekuchesti_ represents &#8220;fluidity&#8221; in physics, describing instability or fluid states. The piece consists of constructions mostly taken from free electro-acoustic improvisations, first recorded to create large elemental plates of experience, and secondly edited and combined into subdivisions of space. There were no structural or material limitations placed on the recording or editing of the improvisations, they simply happened.
> 
> Just as there are myriad structures and surprise events, there are the lack of these events, represented by the isochrons; dating scatterplots of history, constructions made from the lack of material to represent that which has passed on. The sonic architecture of each isochron in this piece is taken from relationships found in the five Platonic (or &#8220;perfect&#8221;) solids, found everywhere in nature, above and below the crust.
> 
> This piece is meant to be played in random order, where the slices intermingle anew each time to create an emergent form. Playing it in order will reveal some of the underlying structure, and is a perfectly acceptable way of listening &#8211; the shapes of the plates become much more clear, but it is an altogether different listening experience. Improvisers are encouraged to play along as well, but if done in a live context, it must be played on shuffle, as this will give the improvisers less expectation of what sounds will appear.
> 
> The work also ties in an immediate tectonic experience: I live only 10 miles from the epicenter of the 5.4 magnitude earthquake which hit the LA area on July 29, just shortly before the album was finalized. It also represents the &#8220;solid ground&#8221; &#8211; both as shared vision and literal Earth &#8211; between me and the constanta-label.ru headquarters in Perm, Russia.

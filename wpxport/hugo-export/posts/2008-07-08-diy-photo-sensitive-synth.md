I&#8217;m excited to be waiting on the arrival of my new Bleep Labs <a title="ThingamaKIT" href="http://bleeplabs.com/thingamakit/" target="_blank">ThingamaKIT</a>.

Not unlike the simple improvising synth I&#8217;ve been working on with VCOs and 2-pole filters, this is a DIY version of their photo-sensitive <a href="http://bleeplabs.com/thingamagoop/ " target="_blank">thingamagoop</a>, described on their website as simply:

&#8220;The Thingamagoops have oscillators just like any synth. On analog synths the oscillator that creates the actual tone you hear is called a VCO or voltage controlled oscillator. The Bleeps work a little differently so weâ€™ll just call it the main oscillator. Instead of using a keyboard, the main oscillator in the Thingamas is controlled by a photocell.&#8221;

It&#8217;s basic, it&#8217;s clean, and best of all it&#8217;s amazingly well priced for the stuff included &#8211; as long as you&#8217;re in it for the soldering, of course, like nuts like me. There&#8217;s some good pics up on the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/772348@N24/pool/" target="_blank">thingamakit flickr group</a>.

Looking forward to a good learning experience and possibly some ideas on how I can improve my homebuilt oddities.
